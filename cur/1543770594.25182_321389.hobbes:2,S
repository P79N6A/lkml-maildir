Note also that framebuffer drivers may also wish to map a bar from a
specific offset and length.  Eg, CyberPro has one BAR which is something
like 16MB large, with the framebuffer in the low addresses and the
registers at 8MB in.  (poor example I know.)
I believe the IXP folk have issues similar to this though, but more
extreme.

Maybe the interface is just wrong.  Maybe it should be:
struct map {
	void __iomem *cpu;
	/* whatever platform data is required */
};
	err = pci_iomap(dev, bar, size, &map);
...
	pci_iounmap(&map);
The reason I suggest this is that we've had problems with the PCI DMA API -
remember that driver people whinged about having to store the dma_addr_t
cookie and we introduced the following crap:
#define DECLARE_PCI_UNMAP_ADDR(ADDR_NAME)       dma_addr_t ADDR_NAME;
#define DECLARE_PCI_UNMAP_LEN(LEN_NAME)         __u32 LEN_NAME;
#define pci_unmap_addr(PTR, ADDR_NAME)          ((PTR)->ADDR_NAME)
#define pci_unmap_addr_set(PTR, ADDR_NAME, VAL) (((PTR)->ADDR_NAME) = (VAL))
#define pci_unmap_len(PTR, LEN_NAME)            ((PTR)->LEN_NAME)
#define pci_unmap_len_set(PTR, LEN_NAME, VAL)   (((PTR)->LEN_NAME) = (VAL))
Let's not make this same mistake again!  (just like we unknowingly
repeated it for the new DMA API... which should have contained the
returned cookies - the platform specific data which may be just the
CPU address for trivial x86 cases - inside a structure with macros
for accessing them.  Magically all the above mess vanishes.)
