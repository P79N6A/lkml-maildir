On the other hand, if the BIOS worked correctly then the ps/2 port would
have no problems regardless of whether USB legacy emulation was on or off.  
Given that the keyboard works during bootup, I see only two possibilities:
	The USB handoff code somehow causes the BIOS to mess up the
	state of the 8042;
	The 8042 driver interacts badly with the firmware when USB
	legacy emulation is on, and the USB handoff code doesn't
	successfully turn off legacy emulation.
My earlier suggestion was an attempt to test the first possibility.  The 
second is harder to test because it implies problems in both the 8042 
driver and the USB handoff code.
