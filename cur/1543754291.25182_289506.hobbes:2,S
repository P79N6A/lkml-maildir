It screws me over right proper.  Can we stick with Andreas's known-working
patch for now, and do the sorting stuff as a separate, later activity?
It would involve:
- Removal of the old sort code
- Introduction of the new sort code
- Migration of the NFS ACL code, XFS and group code over to the new
  implementation.
