It was not missing accidentially, these symbols were defined with 
define_bool before.
I'll think about the define_* syntax, but I will not make the other syntax 
illegal. The current 'bool "prompt"' is already a shortcut for the more 
common requirement:
config FOO
	bool
	prompt '...'
Also note that the role of the default has changed, a default cannot 
override a prompt anymore (it only provides a default value to the 
prompt). The define_* syntax might imply that this is possible, but it 
won't.
bye, Roman
