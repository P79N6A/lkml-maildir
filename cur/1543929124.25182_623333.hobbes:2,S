The illiteracy rates for hardware engineers must be through the roof. Nobody seems capable of reading specifications anymore...
As for the patch, it's a big NAK at this point. Vendors who can't be bothered to follow the standard will have to wait for Ben's separation patches before they can be supported. Then they can have some voodoo front-end to handle their mistakes instead of turning sdhci.c into a collection of hacks and workarounds.
