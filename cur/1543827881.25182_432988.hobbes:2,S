Ok.  Looking closer.  I have found a clear functional bug.
When CONFIG_PCI_MSI is not set.
  move_irq expands to move_native_irq.
  ack_ioapic_vector
    move_native_irq
    ack_ioapic_irq
      move_irq
        move_native_irq
  ack_ioapic_quirk_vector
    move_native_irq
    ack_ioapic_quirk_irq
      move_irq
        move_native_irq
So we wind up calling move_native_irq twice when MSI is disabled where
before your conversion we only ever called it once.  Luckily in
the case where we have the double call vector_to_irq is a noop so
we only migration the same irq twice.
