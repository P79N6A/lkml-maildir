Conceded, I suppose. The usage of EXPORT_SYMBOL() though tends to be for the 
reason of enabling drivers to offer functionality to the kernel -- not for 
people who want to turn the kernel into applications. (Consider for example 
how netfilter is exposed as GPL. You can build applications [routers] out of 
it, but in that case you're doing a work derived off of Linux, and you should 
be abiding by its GPL licensing terms)

I'm not advocating changing the API for no reason / just to piss off out of 
tree developers. I'm just trying to make clear that in these cases, 'stable' 
is just an observation -- not something you can count on.

And the presence of an ABI would be _very_ frustrating to core developers. Not 
only would these people suffer, everyone would -- developer time would be 
wasted dealing with cruft, and forward progress would be slowed.

Perhaps another term may have been more appropriate. What I mean by 'old tech' 
is more 'existing code' -- ie, something you would port. 
And these organizations _are_ afforded the opportunity to take the first step 
-- that's why interfaces critical to drivers are currently EXPORT_SYMBOL().

Sure it does, depending on your perspective and what you're willing to 
consider. The lack of a stable API/ABI means that if you don't want to have 
to do work tracking the kernel, you should push to have your drivers merged.

Perhaps, but calling it 'stable' in any sense other than idle observation is a 
disaster, because the idea leads to pain and suffering when you do have a 
major reason to change the API.
