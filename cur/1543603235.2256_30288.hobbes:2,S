Not quite - a printk from cli() or hardirq context will normally
come out immediately.  The only time the deferred buffering
thing happens is if the console semaphore is found to be already held on
entry to printk().  ie: there is already a printk in progress on another CPU
or on this CPU in non-interrupt context.
The buffered printk output will be printed by the current console-sem
owner before it releases the semaphore.
