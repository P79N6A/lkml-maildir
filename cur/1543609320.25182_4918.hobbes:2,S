A simpler way is to use the kio_fish
 
http://apps.kde.com/na/2/info/id/1331
(I had problem with compiling this under SuSE 7.1 but with
SuSE 7.3 there were no problems)
You browsing will look like:
 fish://192.168.9.99/home/
compare with
 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/
And since it is KDE all KDE programs will be able to use it :-)
(To be sure I tried to create a file with advanced editor and save it
 remote - it worked! :-)
