Well, on the PIIX it is and I guess on anything where it's _not_ fully 
internal an 0xf0 write wouldn't have any effect on IRQ13...
When you earlier mentioned this it seemed 0xed switched on DMI would be good 
enough, but well.
Alan, do you have an opinion on the port 0xf0 write? It should probably 
still be combined with a replacement/deletion for new machines due to the 
bus-locking "bad for real-time" thing you mentioned earlier but in the short 
run it could be a fairly low-impact replacement on anything except a 386+387
We should do a another timing measurement survey and it makes for sligtly 
worse code if we indeed feel it's not safe enough to write anything other 
than 0, but otherwise it's quite minimal.
Rene.
