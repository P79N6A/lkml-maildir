it also allows for an elevator that can merge more so that there are
less seeks...
so it's not all pure artificial ;(
I really don't like doing just-for-benchmark tuning ... but I wonder how
much real workloads this will get too (like installing or upgrading a
bunch of rpms)
As for the smoother IO thing.. there's already a kernel process that
writes this lot out after 5 seconds... so that ought to smooth some of
this out already.... I would hope.
(I'm not arguing this change is wrong, I'm just grinding my teeth on how
long updating rpms already takes... for no apparent reason)
