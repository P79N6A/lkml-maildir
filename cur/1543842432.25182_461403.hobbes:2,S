Me either.  I've had a bug report in the mozilla system for maybe four
years concerning space-stuffing.  Occasionally it comes to life but afaict
nothing ever changes.
I expect it'd be pretty easy to undo the space-stuffing in git. 
In extremis I just do s/^  /^ / and it works.  An automated solution would
need to recognise the appropriate headers (Format=Flowed, iirc).

argh.  That means that email contains two copies of the patch.  So it
applies with `patch --dry-run' then causes havoc with `patch'
