Unfortunately this question is a bit too high level...
You can certain have one driver load another via modprobe (grep for
CONFIG_KMOD), but if both drivers will be required, module dependencies
might simply pull in one of the drivers automatically.
For driver<->driver communication, it is totally dependent on what you
need to communicate.  It could be something as simple as a small, shared
module protected by a spinlock, or something more complex.  Really task
dependent..
