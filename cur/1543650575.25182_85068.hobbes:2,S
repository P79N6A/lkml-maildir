A callback scheme can be _trivially_ implemented use the current epoll.
I'm sure you know exactly how to do it, so I'm not spending more time
explaining it to you.

No it does not, you always fall through do_use_fd(). It's that simple.

See, I believe numbers talks. And it does make a pretty clear point
indeed.

It's not single threaded. It can be used in multithreaded environment if
the one that code the app has a minimal idea of what he's doing. Like
everything else. You cannot use a FILE* wildly sharing it randomly inside
a multithreaded app, and expecting to receive coherent results. Like 95%
of the APIs. Can those APIs be used in a multithreaded environment ? You bet,
with care, like everything that uses freakin' threads.
