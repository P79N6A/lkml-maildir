I tried it once. Then spent a day in fixing all the obvious problems
(addings lots of compile barriers to early bootup and the scheduler 
to make it boot again etc.)
In the end I gave up because there were some weird crashes left
and I ran out of time on this one.
Feel free to retry it, but it'll be lots of work I suspect.
