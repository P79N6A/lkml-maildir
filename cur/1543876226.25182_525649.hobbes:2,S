I have no any idea what is wrong to you. Mainline is
skata to me. For long time now I use windows to work
problems. I cannot play wine games with audio, I
cannot sample video, I cannot use skype, I cannot play
midi. And even linux only things I try do I cannot
share my X, I cannot use more than one vmware. All
those is fix for me with SD. I sorry I answer kernel
email and go away now for good.
