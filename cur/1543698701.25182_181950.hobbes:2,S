Afternoon/Evening/Whatever,
However interesting a debate about the legal status of the GPL is, its
applications to various works, including but not limited to the Linux
Kernel, perhaps a forum like 'linux-legal' could be created to remove
such discussions from the more technical list that linux-kernel is.
I am surprised such a discussion flared up in the LKML as I normally
associate such discussions with the lower scoring threads on SlashDot
(no offence intended to SlashDot itself).
Just my $0.45... (inflation and currency devaluation taken into account)
