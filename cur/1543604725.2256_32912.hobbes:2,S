The poster child of such a case is module unloading. Keeping reference
counts for every even non sleeping use of a module is very painful. 
The current "fix" -- putting module count increases in all possible module 
callers to fix the unload races is slow and ugly and far too subtle to 
get everything right. Waiting quiescent periods before unloading is a nice 
alternative.
