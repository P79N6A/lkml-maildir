The problem is here:

...
 #ifdef MODULE
-#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,0)
-static int sisfb_mode_idx = -1;
-#else
-static int sisfb_mode_idx = MODE_INDEX_NONE;  /* Don't use a mode by default if we are a module */
-#endif
-#else
 static int sisfb_mode_idx = -1;               /* Use a default mode if we are inside the kernel */
 #endif
...
<--  snip  -->
It's easy to see that you removed too much (or too few, since the
#ifdef MODULE can be removed - there's also a similar no longer 
required #ifdef MODULE in sis_main.c).
