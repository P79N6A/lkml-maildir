becouse that doesn't begin to address all the benifits.
the approach of fixing page reclaim and updatedb is pretending that if you 
only do everything right pages won't get pushed to swap in the first 
place, and therefor swap prefetch won't be needed.
this completely ignores the use case where the swapping was exactly the 
right thing to do, but memory has been freed up from a program exiting so 
that you couldnow fill that empty ram with data that was swapped out.
