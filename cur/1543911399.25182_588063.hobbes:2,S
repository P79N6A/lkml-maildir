I too had thought about this problem. I think email clients do wordwrap
to improve readability. But, in some cases we just might have to
override. ( I had an experience of sending a malformed patch just
because my wordwrap setting for vim and my email client were different)
What should be ideally expected out of a good email client?
Is it sufficient if the email client provides a facility to disable
wordwrap while inserting file alone and does wordwrap while typing text?
or is it expected to provide a configurable option to enable/disable
wordwrap. I don't think keeping wordwrap disabled all the time is a good
idea because it makes it difficult to read mails.
Do we have a suggested wordwrap setting w.r.t kernel code?
