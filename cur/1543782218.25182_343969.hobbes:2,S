If the app can plan ahead as you're proposing, why doesn't it just
mmap the maximum it might need, mprotect PROT_NONE the end it doesn't
need yet, then progressively re-mprotect parts to make them accessible
as needed?
I'm missing what mremap gives you here that mprotect doesn't.  Though
I do see that it would be nice not to be forced into mremap moving
all the time, because of other maps blocking you off: nice perhaps
to know what region of the layout is least likely to be so affected.
