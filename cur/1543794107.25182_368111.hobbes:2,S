Subject: workqueue is not working?

I tried to schedule some work in an softirq handler. The way I did is
as follows:
I use create_workqueue to initialize a workqueue "vrpciod_workqueue",
in the softirq, I do INIT_WORK(work, func, data), and then
queue_work(vrpciod_workqueue, work);
I think func() should be called a bit later. However, I noticed that
func() is never called by the workqueue. I don't know why.
Can soneone give me some suggestions? Many thanks!
Xin
