What is missing here is a good authoritative web ressource that tells
people which NIC to buy.
I have a tulip NIC because a few years ago that apparently was the NIC
of choice.  It has good multicast (which is important to me), but AFAIK
it has neither scatter-gather nor hardware checksumming.
Is there such a web page already?
If not, I volunteer to create amd maintain one.
