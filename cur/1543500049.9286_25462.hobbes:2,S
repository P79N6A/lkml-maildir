Hello !
I've got 2 sco openserver 5 (3.2v5.0.4) as shown here :
 hades  ---- linux firewall ---- atlas
 hades have ip : 10.0.0.129 / netmask : 255.255.255.224
            gw : 10.0.0.158 / broadcast : 10.0.0.159
 atlas have ip : 10.0.0.3   / netmask : 255.255.255.128
            gw : 10.0.0.126 / broadcast : 10.0.0.127
 the left interface of the linux firewall have :
            ip : 10.0.0.158 / netmask : 255.255.255.224 / broadcast 10.0.0.159
 
 the right interface of the linux firewall have :
            ip : 10.0.0.126 / netmask : 255.255.255.128 / broadcast 10.0.0.127
Okay here the problem....
 the two machines cannot speak each other (ping / traceroute / telnet / ...)
 but on the same network of atlas, ns1 is pingable / traceroutable from hades...
 Seems something stop the communication between each others...
 But the most strange this is the linux firewall is setup to let got EVERYTHING....
 Does someone have any clues ???
