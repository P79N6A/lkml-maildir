Which kernel version did you get these results using?  Have you speed-tested the
drive(s) on a different SATA controller?  I don't mean to imply that you should
buy another one - that would be rediculuous since your motherboard should
laready has it - but it would help to eliminate possible causes of error.  I
took the same readings on my machine.  I'm using an ASUS SK8N motherboard -
that's the Promise TX2 SATA controller - with Western Digital's 36gb 10K RPM
Raptor:
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.12 seconds =1075.79 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.20 seconds = 53.43 MB/sec
I'm using the latest stable vanilla kernel (2.6.5), compiled today.  It would
also help to have your kernel config, if at all possible.
