hi to everybody,
i have a problem getting the modules in the right order to boot up 
properly. I have a thinkpad r40 with a ati radeon 5600 mobility. The 
agpgart-driver is compiled within the kernel, while the other drivers 
are compiled as modules(ati-agp, radeon, radeonfb). 'lsmod' shows that 
all these modules are loaded, but X is not starting from kdm after boot 
up. 'dmesg' produces "[drm radeon_cp_init] *ERROR* radeon_cp_init called 
without lock held". when i log in at console and type 'startx' it is 
working...
Has anyone experiencend these problems himself???
thank you
Mathias Peters
