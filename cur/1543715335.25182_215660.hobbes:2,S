  Hi!
  I've attached a fix for a problem in ext3 journalled quota patch - the
problem is that detecting whether dqput() sleeps was wrong and so we
could possibly schedule when holding a spinlock. If you applied the
patch for journalled quota please apply also this one.
  Andrew, can you please apply the patch to your kernel?
							Thanks
