To cite a popular manufacturer directly from the homepage:
"... and a data transfer rate of up to 5 megabytes per second"
Please note the "up to" and that this drive is an affordable latest
generation ADR streamer.
Last time I looked the speed was still specified per minute since they
are (were?) so slow. Also note than an iPod has a data transfer rate of
5MB/s, modern drives (even when crammed into an USB2/Firewire casing) 
beat that by a magnitude yet are a whole lot cheaper than a good
streamer.
FWIW: The streamer in my office is in the happy 100MB/m (compressed)
league.
Streamers are only interesting for lots of data, for normal use they're
not only too slow but also too expensive.

Check tomshardware or whatever magazine you prefer to read. Modern cases
(like the ones with the Oxford chipsets) deliver almost the same
performance as a built-in controller.
