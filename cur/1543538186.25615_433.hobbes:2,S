Hi guys,
I noticed the difference in schedule_timeout() between test1-ac18 (which I
run) and Linus test3-pre2 (which I read) and Linus' version uses the
foo_struct to handle the wakeup when the timeout expires - basically, the
difference is that a call to timer_exit(timer) is made by
process_timeout().
Anyone understands which way is the correct one? Is the AC version going
to be migrated into Linus' or not? I.e. should one generally call
timer_exit() on the timer in the timer's handler function?
Regards,
Tigran
