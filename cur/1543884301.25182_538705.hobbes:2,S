Hi David,

Your version makes one wonder why they didn't use
"__attribute__((unused))".  Obviously the __attribute_unused__ macro
exists for a reason, so they wonder what's the difference between that
and the attribute?  The answer: nothing.
OTOH, your point about "__unneeded" is well taken.  "__needed" and
"__optional" perhaps?  But their feature is *exactly* that the don't
look like the gcc attributes, hence avoid their semantic screwage.

Sure; historically we refactor around it.  But warnings are now so
commonplace few people care 8(
