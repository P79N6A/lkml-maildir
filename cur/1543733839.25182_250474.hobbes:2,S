well ramfs by definition is XIP :)
but I guess the filesystem comes from flash somewhere at which point
jffs2 with compression might be a better choice; if you have enough ram
then the apps run from the pagecache anyway and compression keeps you
from transfering too much data from the slower flash. It's not XIP but I
don't think you really want XIP...
