They are free to, but I've rarely(never?) seen GCC actually do it with the
default build setup.  Don't trust me - look at a generated ASM listing and
convince yourself what I'm saying is true.  GCC does a lot of massive
reordering within functions though.
Throw a "CFLAGS += -Wa,-al=$<.lst" at the top of the Makefile.  That'll
generate a "process.c.lst" assembler listing file.
IAC, it would be harmless if one did, and goodness if one doesn't.  That
sounds like a win to me :)
