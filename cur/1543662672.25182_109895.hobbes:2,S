Degrees C is the best choice, because the range of values that fit in
to a signed int is then useful (-127 -> 128).  Storing as K or F means
that you can't store a useful range in a single byte.

Magnetic media                       -> disk
Optical media                        -> disc
Combination media, (magneto-optical) -> disk
