I don't against changing swiotlb library to make it usable for Xen.

If you seriously think "adding highmem support to x86_64 would
happen", please take a look at:

Adding such complication to the generic swiotlb code seriously hurts
its readability and maintainability. X86_64 and IA64 should not surfer
such damage.
