Thanks Paul, this looks a little simpler than the patch I posted (I'd rather 
just make CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM and CONFIG_VIRTUAL_MEMMAP mandatory on ia64, 
but that's for another patch).  Linus, since this breakage is in your tree 
now, can you please apply this assuming Tony has no complaints so that people 
can build on ia64 again?
Thanks,
Jesse
