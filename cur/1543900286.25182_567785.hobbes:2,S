No, it's fine.  The relevant comment is up at the entry to shmem_getpage:
	struct page *filepage = *pagep;  /* (moved down, I'm cheating!) */
	/*
	 * Normally, filepage is NULL on entry, and either found
	 * uptodate immediately, or allocated and zeroed, or read
	 * in under swappage, which is then assigned to filepage.
	 * But shmem_readpage and shmem_prepare_write pass in a locked
	 * filepage, which may be found not uptodate by other callers
	 * too, and may need to be copied from the swappage read in.
	 */
So down at the exit from shmem_getpage, in the shmem_readpage case,
filepage _is_ *pagep, and so it skips that unlock_page - the caller
passed in a locked page, it's up to the caller to unlock it; but
the general ->readpage interface then demands that shmem_readpage
unlock the page which was passed in to it with lock held.  
(The *pagep != filepage test is also trying to skip the unlock_page
in the case when shmem_getpage needed to allocate the page itself,
but couldn't: both *pagep and filepage NULL.)
Ironically, the need for shmem_getpage to handle the case of a page
passed into it almost vanished - Nick's upcoming aops ->write_begin
abolishes the shmem_prepare_write case - but now it is needed for
readpage for splice: but I'm hoping perhaps we'll devise a readpage
replacement more like write_begin/write_end, then can eliminate it.
