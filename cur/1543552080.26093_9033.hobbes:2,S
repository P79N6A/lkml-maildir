It's probably particularly nasty under NFS because of
invalidate_inode_pages(). The latter empties the page cache whenever
we can no longer trust it and calls remove_inode_page() on every
unlocked page. It won't care whether the page is mmapped or not.
My guess is therefore that the line setting 'page->mapping = NULL' in
__remove_inode_page() is a candidate for scrutiny...
