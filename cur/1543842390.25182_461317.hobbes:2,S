To be honest, once you get to the point of having an OPEN_NONFILE_W  
capability you should really just be using SELinux.  Instead of  
spewing policy all over your filesystem xattrs you put it all into a  
single set of fairly admin-readable policy files, and it includes  
more fine-grained operations than you have space for in 32 bits of  
"un"-capabilities.  It also conveniently supports the existing pseudo- 
POSIX capabilities.  You can effectively say "root, netadmin, and  
netuser users are allowed to run ping programs which automatically  
transition into the ping domain and get CAP_NET_RAW privileges" in  
your binary policy, then just leave ping as chmod "755" and be done  
with it.
