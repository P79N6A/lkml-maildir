On my G5 it takes ~200 cycles to zero a whole page.  In other words it
takes about the same time to zero a page as to bring in a single cache
line from memory.  (PPC has an instruction to establish a whole cache
line of zeroes in modified state without reading anything from
memory.)
Thus I can't see how prezeroing can ever be a win on ppc64.

Paul.
