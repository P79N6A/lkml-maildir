There is some old version:
http://namesys.com/pub/misc-patches/unsupported/extra/2004.02.04/p06-locallock.patch
http://namesys.com/pub/misc-patches/unsupported/extra/2004.02.04/p07-locallock-bkl.patch
http://namesys.com/pub/misc-patches/unsupported/extra/2004.02.04/p08-locallock-zone.patch
http://namesys.com/pub/misc-patches/unsupported/extra/2004.02.04/p0b-atomic_dec_and_locallock.patch
http://namesys.com/pub/misc-patches/unsupported/extra/2004.02.04/p0c-locallock-dcache.patch
This version retains original spin-lock interface (i.e., no additional
"queue link" pointer is passed to the locking function). As a result,
lock data structure contains an array of NR_CPU counters, so it's only
suitable for global statically allocated locks.
