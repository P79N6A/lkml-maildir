Please verify that the patch is applied and working by
excluding acpi_dbg_level=1 from the cmdline and verifying
that you get some new "NOT disabled" lines in the dmesg.
Please restore the IOAPIC support so we get the print_PIC
lines back per the original debug patch, and boot with
"nolapic" "apic=debug" "pci=routeirq"
and send along the dmesg.  This will tell us about
the state of IRQ6 when we get it from the BIOS
and how Linux changes it.
Also, if you can send or point me the output from acpidmp,
available in /usr/sbin or in pmtools:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
I'd like to examine the ASL associated with the
interrupt link that is camped on IRQ6.
thanks,

ps. In addition to soft-power-off, I expect that ACPI is required
to enable IOAPIC support on this system.
