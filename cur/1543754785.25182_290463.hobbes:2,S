yes, this was by far the biggest problem randomisation caused. Note that
while Fedora offers a personality-hack to disable randomisation on the
fly, which Wine could have made use of to have the fix automatically;
Alexandre didnt want to rely on it in Wine because that flag's semantics
(PER_LINUX32) were not upstream. (and i very much agree with Alexandre
on that call).
But once something like this is upstream i believe Wine can (and will)
have a robust legacy-binary-format loader that is not affected by
randomisation effects, with minimal changes.
