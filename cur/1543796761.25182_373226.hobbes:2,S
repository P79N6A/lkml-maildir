Most likely people bring up the "derivative works" issue because
that's what the GPL says it affects.  The FSF contends that linking
creates a derivative work, but is curiously quiet when people ask for
statutory or case law to support that claim.
Besides, if the act of linking is what makes the derivative work,
there is no problem: The GPL allows a user to make any modifications
or combinations or derivatives whatsoever, and only imposes
requirements when the result is distributed.  The linking of the two
works occurs only on the end user's machine.
