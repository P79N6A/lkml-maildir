there will be more such issues with more complex namespaces. That's why 
I proposed to use containers.
Any way, right now, I don't think this should be urgently fixed as there 
are many other ways to crash the node when you are a root.
The rule is simple - the process changing the namespace should be 
simple, w/o IPCs. For more complex namespaces (e.g. resource management 
namespaces) a fork() can be required after unshare().

do we need really it?
my point is that while with IPCs it maybe quite easy since semundo code 
already exists it can be still very hard for other namespaces which do 
not track its objects associated with the task.
BTW, do we have the same problem with shm? What will happen if the task 
having shm segment will change it's IPC namespace? Besides the possible 
crash/stability bugs there can be more interesting effects, for example:
"user will be able to do operations on existing objects with new 
namespace limitations?"...
Thanks,
Kirill
