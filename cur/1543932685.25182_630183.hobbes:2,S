In discussions BenH and I have had, we've actually concluded that
moving this from platform drivers to of_platform drives is not
actually a good idea.
In fact we're planning to move away from of_platform devices and
drivers and instead develop a framework for instantiating platform
devices or i2c devices or whatever devices from the device tree nodes.
