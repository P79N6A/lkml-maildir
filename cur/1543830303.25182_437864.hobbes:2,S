this little something on top (instead of reverting the patch) also fixes the
problem for me. because the module name depends on the name of module.mod.o
it's necessary to call basename twice on that, otherwise the name ends up
being module.mod
maybe we could also define basetarget in Kbuild.include as:
	basetarget = $(basename $(basename $(notdir $@)))
but that might be too much...dunno
