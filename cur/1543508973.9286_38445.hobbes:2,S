With in_use in such place we mean "in_use by somebody else too". When
bforget is called b_count is always >= 1. So if decreasing it make b_count
zero and so atomic_dec_and_test returned 1, then it means the buffer is
not in use by another user too and we can simply forgot it. If it's inuse
by sombody else too (atomic_dec_and_test returned zero) then we have to
take the brelse path.
