I've got one setup on which this doesn't seem to help much... Two firewire 
drives (both ox911 bridge, v4.0 firmware) hooked to a system, both of which 
are recognized, logged into, etc., on startup. However, pretty much without 
fail, at least one of them has to perform a reconnection. That claims to 
succeed, but the device isn't actually usable when this happens -- 
fdisk /dev/sdx fails with 'unable to read /dev/sdx'.
Example dmesg output when one of the two drives has to be reconnected:

Given the READ CAPACITY failed and DID_BUS_BUSY messages for sdc (and lack of 
notice about its partitions), it sort of looks like we never set the disk up 
correctly in the first place, and we're subsequently just reconnecting to 
that failed setup... So the reconnect code may be doing the right thing, and 
the real problem I'm looking at is us screwing up the setup of the device in 
the first place, for some reason...
