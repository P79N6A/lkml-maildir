This thread is dead.  I am porting the MANOS debugger to Linux, and I
have dissolved TRG's incestuous relationship with Microsoft so we could
integrate a full NTFS on Linux -- two issues down.  NDS provides no
value to Linux unless it's integrated into the OS, which will happen
when MANOS goes out next year around March.   NDS is more of a Microsoft
play than a Linux play and Linux already has better internet directory
technology than NDS -- NDS is better for managing LAN's.
