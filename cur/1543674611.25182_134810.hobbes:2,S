No. Please do not assume that the above is equivalent to calling
notify_change() with ATTR_MTIME|ATTR_CTIME.
NFS tends to leave the above to the server side, since the clocks may
be desynchronized between client and server.
As far as NFS is concerned, we should only be setting ATTR_*TIME if/when
the *user* specifies it through a utimes() call or something like that.
Cheers,
