You cannot prove this without validating the data in software.
Otherwise, you are not handling the hardware-fault case.
It is foolish to presume that hardware always works correctly.  It is 
-very- foolish to presume this, in cryptography.

Use the current chrdev->rngd method.

The user cannot know the data is bad unless it is constantly being 
validated.
