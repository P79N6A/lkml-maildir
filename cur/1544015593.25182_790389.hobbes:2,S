mb862xx: Restrict compliation of platform driver to PPC
The OpenFirmware part of this driver is uncompilable on SPARC due to it's dependance on several PPC specific functions.
Restricting this to PPC to prevent these build errors.
This was found using randconfig builds.

A couple of notes:
1. After looking at the includes used by this driver, the OF part may not compile cleanly on PPC either as it doesn't appear to pull in the required headers for all the functions and constants it uses.
2. Also, this bug will *not* show up in allmodconfigs or allyesconfigs as the OF part of this driver is prevented from building when the PCI driver is built, and the PCI driver appears first.
3. This patch is over DaveM's sparc-2.6 git tree as of today.
4. I apologise for the massive cross-posting - I am not sure where exactly to send this patch.
5. Please note that I am not a member of any of these lists, so please keep me CC'd.
Thanks,
Julian Calaby
