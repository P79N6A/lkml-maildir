Is that up to date?  I cloned that repository and said "make" and got
heaps of compile errors.  First there were a heap of warnings like
this:
symbol.h:73: warning: declaration does not declare anything
and then lots of errors like this:
parse.c:44: error: structure has no member named `ctype'
and indeed the structures defined in the headers don't seem to match
up with their uses in the .c files.
Paul.
