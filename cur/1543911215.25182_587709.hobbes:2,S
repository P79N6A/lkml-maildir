The flag actually needs a recent gcc 4.3 snapshot (it's
a new feature the gcc developers added especially for the
kernel :), so if this didn't work it would fail on the vast 
majority of systems.
Somehow it doesn't? At least here it compiles fine.
I notice the final comma is missing, Mel does it work
when you change the line to 
cflags-y += $(call cc-option,-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3,)  
If not please run
gcc -O2 -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -S -xc /dev/null -o x.o 
echo $?
What does the echo output?
