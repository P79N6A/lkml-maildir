The difference being that root _is_ allowed to crash the kernel. No, this
is more a question of providing a "cooked" interface or not. I generally
believe in cooked itnerfaces when they can abstract away differences in
lower levels. However, given the possible damage caused by an error I can
certainly understand if Linus chooses to include it.
The discussion has not been so much whether this patch is a good idea as
it has been about the claim that it is a security patch protecting from a
malicious root.
