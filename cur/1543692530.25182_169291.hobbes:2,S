I discovered that -test6-mm1 doesn't build with -ffreestanding with gcc 3.3.1,
for an odd reason:  when I specify -ffreestanding, it generates 'call abs' calls
where it was able to do it inline otherwise. -ffreestanding says there's no library,
so it can't inline the library call (which leaves no external call to 'abs()').
