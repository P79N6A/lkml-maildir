If you fixed the oopsing 2.5.8-pre1 kernel by putting 'lock_kernel()'
in exit.c, then you have to remove that line.
The correct fix was applied later, and if you leave in the call
to 'lock_kernel()' you get the exact message you're reporting.
If line 505 of kernel/exit.c is lock_kernel() in your tree then delete
it, and try again.
