So you expect kernel support?  Normally, real people write or
modify applications to provide for specific exceptions to
the standards. They don't expect an operating system to
modify itself to unique situations. That's not what
operating systems have generally done in the past.
The 'C' runtime library interfaces to the kernel. You
can use the ld.so.preload capabilities to substitute
private functions for fork(), etc. This has the additional
benefit of allowing crappy, poorly-written, executables
that may have buffer overflows to be executed with
increased confidence. Of course, some root-shell programs
bypass the 'C' runtime libraries.
Cheers,
