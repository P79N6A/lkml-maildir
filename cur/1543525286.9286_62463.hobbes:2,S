Subject: GPF's with kernel 2.3.43

I haven't seen this reported yet, but that might be because I am getting
the kernel-digest feed.
Should I just stay away from the 2.3.4x series altogether?  They seem
almost as bad as the 2.1.4x series did.  For now I guess it's going back
to 2.3.34 again....
basically, I have a k6-2 350Mhz with 64Megs of ram.  On bootup about half
of the programs run by "init" gave errors such as this:
c0126260 T vmfree_area_pages
c0126410 T vmalloc_area_pages
c0126730 T get_vm_area
can GPF's be run through a symbols table like an oops?
