Hugh,
My changes go to Marcelo via Andy.  This one has been waiting in his
staging area while he was out on vacation.  Now that he is back --
unless something broke in his tree -- I assume he'll be sending it along
to Marcelo shortly.
Cheers,
-Len
Ps. If you'd like to see the code, here it is:
Andy's tree:

Pps. Feel free to use my intel e-mail account -- I use my yahoo account
mostly to reduce spam so I don't read it every day.
