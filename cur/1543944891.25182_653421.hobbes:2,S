Sort of like this?  For drivers that don't want to list themselves
in Kconfig as depending on GENERIC_GPIO (e.g. one NAND driver I heard
about), this lets them use <linux/gpio.h> ... existing code can't
break, and it won't hurt if new code uses this.

============== CUT HERE
Add a <linux/gpio.h> defining fail/warn stubs for GPIO calls on
platforms that don't support the GPIO programming interface.  It
includes the arch-specific interface glue otherwise.
