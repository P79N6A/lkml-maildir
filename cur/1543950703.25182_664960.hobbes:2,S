Hello Avi,
in commit fb56dbb31c4738a3918db81fd24da732ce3b4ae6 you changed 
include/linux/Kbuild:
----snip----
KVM: Export include/linux/kvm.h only if $ARCH actually supports KVM
Currently, make headers_check barfs due to <asm/kvm.h>, which <linux/kvm.h>
includes, not existing.  Rather than add a zillion <asm/kvm.h>s, export 
kvm.h only if the arch actually supports it.
[...]
 unifdef-y += keyboard.h
-unifdef-y += kvm.h
+unifdef-$(CONFIG_HAVE_KVM) += kvm.h
 unifdef-y += llc.h
 unifdef-y += loop.h
----snip------
This patch does not work. Kbuild (scripts/Makefile.headersinst) does not 
check the config file, so kvm.h is never installed.
Sam is there an easy way to allow constructs like "unifdef-$(CONFIG_FOO)"?
Thanks
Christian
