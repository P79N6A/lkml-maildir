There's always the possibility to build upon AVFS 
(
http://www.inf.bme.hu/~mszeredi/avfs
), either using the LD_PRELOAD 
version improved by Frederik Eaton, or the version using the (CODA or 
better the) FUSE kernel module (the latter is still in development 
from what I hear).
We have built a DB backed filesystem for use in a content management 
system (
http://www.ethlife.ethz.ch/newcms
), based on the AVFS 
LD_PRELOAD version, and embedding perl so we could write the actual 
filesystem implementation in perl. It has required quite a bit of 
labour, but works well for our purpose now. It's GPL'd, but not yet 
polished for publication, so contact me if you're interested.
Christian.
