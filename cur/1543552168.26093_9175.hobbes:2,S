Note that I dislike "wrapper.h", and I just removed that part.
I don't think it's any clearer to write "vma_reserve(vma)" than it is to
just say "vma->vm_flags |= VM_RESERVE". 
But yes, add that line and remove the swapout, and you should be golden -
no unnecessary faults (well, it won't pre-fault, of course) and no trouble
with calculating locked pages.
