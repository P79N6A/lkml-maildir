Thanks, that explains it. Anybody who allocated region 1000 and 1400 would 
clash with the built-in PIIX magic IO regions, and any driver that tried 
to access those regions would instead end up accessing magic SMBus or ACPI 
registers.
So your lock-ups are very understandable indeed, and I'll apply this to 
the standard kernel. MUCH better than reverting the IO window limits.
