I don't think renaming things make them any different.

ah, that is much better - what you are saying is the above code should
look like:
if (IS_BLK(inode->i_mode) & inode->i_bdev) {
        bdput(inode->i_bdev);
        inode->i_bdev = NULL;
}
Then it is a typical tradeoff between speed and memory optimizations - we
gain 4 bytes in the inode but get an extra comparison instruction in the
code. To me, speed is more important - extra memory one can always buy but
the time... hmmm redeem the time for the days are evil.
