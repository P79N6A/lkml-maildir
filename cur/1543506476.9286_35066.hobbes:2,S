: When you apply the 2.3.15 pre1 patch, you must answer 'y' when it asks
: you if it should apply a reversed patch.  drivers/video/modedb.c was
: omitted from 2.3.14, and the patch for it is reversed in 2.3.15 pre1.
That explains it.  I assumed that that meant modedb.c was in 2.3.14 and not
supposed to be.  Thanks
