Probably not a big deal, but yeah, we should have that broken-ppro option.

This one I disagree with. The *old* code doesn't honor NT stores *either*. 
The fact is, if you use NT stores and then depend on ordering, it has 
nothing what-so-ever to do with spinlocks or smp_[rw]mb. You need to use 
the DMA barriers (ie the non-smp ones).
The non-temporal stores should be basically considered to be "IO", not any 
normal memory operation.
