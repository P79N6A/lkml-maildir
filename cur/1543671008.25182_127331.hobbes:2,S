low-level benchmarking is somehow performance critical :-)
note that direct-IO here is _only_ bonus, main goal is to
use the same code for _all_ ioctl and fs generated IDE IO
(remember that all fs IDE IO is rq->bio based)
and this is work-in-progress...

Rework of bio_map_user() and co. is minimal and not needed but otherwise
I will have to duplicate same code in 4 places. bio_map_user() now does
allocated bio checking and grabs extra reference to bio which all users of
old bio_map_user() have to do anyway (and they will probably forgot to).
