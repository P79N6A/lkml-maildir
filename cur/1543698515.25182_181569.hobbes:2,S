Btw, I had trouble creating a linear array (probably not very common)
with size > 2 TB.  I expected it to just complain, but it ended up
resulting in hard lockups.  With a slight size change (removed one
drive), it ended up printing a double fault Oops, and all sorts of neat
stuff.  I suspect the hashing was overflowing and writing bits in
unexpected places.
In any event, this patch against 2.6.0-test11 compiles without warnings,
boots, and (bonus) actually works:
