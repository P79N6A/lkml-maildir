I booted your latest patch on a 4-way SMP box (1.5 GHz, 9MB ia64). This
is what it produces.  I think the estimate is excellent.

[02]:  10.4(0) 10.4(0)    -    10.4(0)

cacheflush times [1]: 10.4 (10448800)
One other minor thing: when booting a numa kernel on smp box, there is
a numa scheduler domain at the top level and cache_hot_time will be set
to 0 in that case on smp box.  Though this will be a mutt point with
recent patch from Suresh Siddha for removing the extra bogus scheduler
domains.  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=111240208000001&r=1&w=2
