Oops. So this is not broken HW/BIOS, but definitely a kernel problem?
Only idea that comes to my mind finding this is to grep through the DSDT
and look out for code that accesses CPU throttling HW ports. Maybe ACPI
subsystem gets something wrong, processing this code and activating
throttling by accident?
Anyway, only solution/workaround to use these machines with current
kernels is to override trip points, maybe the patch should really just
be reverted...
