If I wanted to develop something which would eventually go into 
mainline, I certainly would do it against Linus' tree. There are many 
things going on in -mm which might or might not require significant 
changes in approach to work. I think -mm is a great place to try the 
scheduler of the week, but unless some feature requires one of those, 
it's easier to start from a known base.
