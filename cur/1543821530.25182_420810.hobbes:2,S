But that doesn't solve the problem for framebuffer devices or for the  
s390 code.  Such transactions have one or more of the following  
properties:
(1)  A read operation is _expensive_ or adds unacceptable latencies  
and should be done as rarely as possible
(2)  The data must be all written to hardware simultaneously by the  
kernel; a partial update does not make sense and would cause  
undesired operation from the hardware.
The idea with the transactions would be to create a kernel-memory  
buffer-layer of sorts on top of the underlying sysfs tree to cache  
the read data and collect writes for an atomic commit.  I'll see if I  
can make something work.
Cheers,
