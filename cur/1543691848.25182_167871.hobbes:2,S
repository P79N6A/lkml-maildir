I don't think that it is "normal" for applications to do unaligned
memory access.  It means that:
a) the programmer is playing fast and loose with types and/or casts.
b) the end-user is going to be disappointed with the performance.
Looking at a couple of ia64 build servers here I see zero unaligned
access messages in the logs.
