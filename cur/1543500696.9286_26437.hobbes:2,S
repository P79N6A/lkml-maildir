Come on, you have to be more clueful... you must be joking.

Yes, you can catch some bugs with debug code.

Exactly how? This is totally wrong. You can't _detect_ random
bit patterns ever, because they have meaning. I'd say you are
telling me that kernel code is always perfect.
Following your logic, all of userspace VM should be mapped.
If users can't segfault (no bug detected because all addresses
are mapped), then there are no bugs. The code is perfect if
you don't get a segfault, right?
Ingo's way:
You have flags A, B, C, and D. Most bit patterns are illegal.
When B and C are both set, you _know_ there is a bug.
Your way:
You have flags X and Y. No bit patterns are illegal. If a bug
sets both flags by accident... well, nobody can tell that
something has gone seriously wrong. I'm sure that _bad_ things
happen when you treat a normal data block like a hole.
