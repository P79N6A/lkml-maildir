Yes, because the the nfs client is broken in this respect. noac 
should mean noac, but the nfs client will still cache attributes if the 
second access happens within the same jiffy as the previous access which 
updated the attribute cache.
Replacing a couple of time_after() calls with time_after_eq() calls 
fixes the issue, at least for hlfsd. Of course, running with noac might 
be very much unacceptable if all you want is to avoid caching symlinks.

No. Do it on a per-mount basis, like the other OS's do.
