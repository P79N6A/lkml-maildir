Hmm, but document it where, since there is no single destroy_context()
definition?  At the mmput() and __mmdrop() definitions in kernel/fork.c?
(like so: ?)

Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: check for proper mm->context before destroying
arch/powerpc/mm/mmu_context_64.c:destroy_context() can be called
from __mmput() in do_execve() if init_new_context() failed.  This
can result in idr_remove() being called for an invalid context.
So, don't call idr_remove if there is no context.
