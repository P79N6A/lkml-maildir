It will be because you haven't supplied the io_hi parameter; to tell
it _not_ to probe for an ECR register at base+0x400, you need to
supply 'io_hi=0,0'.
There is a patch for some NetMos cards, but unfortunately it seems to
suffer from the same problem anyway, which suggests that the code is
buggy in some way. :-(
