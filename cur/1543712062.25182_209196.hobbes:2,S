It is, however, useless for the _other_ reasons userspace needs to
know kernel HZ, including as I mentioned userspace timer granularity.
(Btw, that usage would be better as a period rather than a frequency,
so that a "tickless" kernel can report zero).
The fundamental problem is that there are two values, and both values
have programs which can usefully use them.
How hard can it be to export both?
