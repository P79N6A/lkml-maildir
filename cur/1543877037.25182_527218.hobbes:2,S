The main difference is that disk-backed swap can create I/O pressure which
would slow down the swap-outs that are not of zeroed pages (and other I/Os
on that disk for that matter). For purely-RAM virtual memory the latency 
incured from managing newly allocated and zeroed pages is neglegible 
compared to the latencies you get from reading/flushing those pages to 
disk if you add swap to the picture.

I agree. The swap I/O case still holds, though: swapping-in the zeroed
pages that got swapped-out might incur unwanted overhead.
