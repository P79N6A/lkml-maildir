   How is it that I'm not experiencing any of the problems in 2.2.11?
   I don't get problems from tcp memory leaks and the vmware modules
   compile perfectly even though they said they don't!
   I patched from 2.2.9 to 2.2.11 - is it possible that this didn't
   work properly? I didn't get any errors from patch and 'uname -r'
   and the very first kernel message all report 2.2.11!
It doesn't hit you if you don't get TIME_WAIT connections which
receive retransmitted FIN's from the other end, which is usually (but
not always) an occurance on machines running servers talking to
clients over lossy links.
