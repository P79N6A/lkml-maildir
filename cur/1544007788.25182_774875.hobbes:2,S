IMHO, from a purely "tree organization" point of view, it would be best if
arch-specific platform drivers were under drivers/platform/<arch>/.  And
arch/ be left for the core arch-specific stuff.
Whether that would work well, when arch maintenance factors are taken into
account, I don't know.

drivers/platform/<arch> would help in that regard, I think.
