I'm willing to use whatever minor number and range the community agrees upon.
An alternative idea, which one person already shot down, was to allow only 4 devices 
normally, but allow more devices if you use udev, since udev doesn't care about minor 
number assignments.  This eliminates the overlap and encourages people to use udev.
