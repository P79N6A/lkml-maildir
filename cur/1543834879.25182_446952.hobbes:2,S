Nitpick: any reason not to just get rid of the local variable "serv"
after that?

The warning is printk'ed a little inconsistently.  (If we care, maybe it
should just go inside make_socks?)
By the way, why don't most callers use the error returned from
lockd_up()?

So I guess it's a minor point, but: we take the trouble to only open tcp
or udp sockets as necessary, but then won't close them down till all the
mounts and nfsd's go away at which point we close them all down.
Would it be that bad just to always listen on both?
