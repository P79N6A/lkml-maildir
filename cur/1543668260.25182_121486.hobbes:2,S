OK, this definitely makes a big difference for my test cases which
include that 'tar' above as well as a run of dvd::rip.  Without this
patch everything else on my system drops to a total crawl, especially
which dvd::rip is running, dvd::rip itself won't even switch tabs.  With
this patch everything seems quite normal and snappy.
I'll try a few more test cases but backing this out certainly seems to
restore the system to the same behavior as 2.5.64.  BTW, I'm running
this on 2.5.65-mm4.  I would have tested on 2.5.66-mm1 but for some
reason my system locks solid after only a few minutes with it.  I
haven't tried to track that down yet.
Later,
Tom
