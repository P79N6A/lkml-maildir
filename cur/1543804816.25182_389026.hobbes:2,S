I haven't tried using nv with grabdisplay instead of overlay, but I have 
recently run a large (nvidia...and no, I don't work for them) patch 
against the 81.78 driver (about 5 small patches all in one) and it works 
successfully on 2.6.16-rc1-git3 (in both grabdisplay and overlay 
modes).  The only thing I noted is that the old nvidia binaries wanted a 
channel frequency offset of 108, but with the (heavily patched) 81.78 
driver, you don't need an channel frequency offset (both xawtv and 
mplayer).  Your test is simple to try though, and if it doesn't work, 
I'll reply and mention it.   Thanks for your reply.
