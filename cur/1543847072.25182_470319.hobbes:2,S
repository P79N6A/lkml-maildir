If you want your usb network card suspended... there's perfectly fine
interface to do that. It is called "ifconfig usbeth0 down".

What you want is fairly hard to implement in kernel, and it is not
clear if it is kernel job after all. "Transparent" is nice, but
"simple kernel code" is nice, too.
If you have very simple&easy&nice&transparent kernel code that can do
what you want, fine; but maybe we want to trade "transparent" for
"KISS".
