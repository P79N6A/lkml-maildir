Really this should have been folded into the patch which it fixes.  We get
a cleaner history that way, and it protects git-bisectability.
Yes, it can mean that people lose credit points.  I make that up by adding
a little note in the signoffs in the form
[foo@bar.com: <whatever [s]he did>]
box:/usr/src/git26> git-log | grep ' \[akpm' | wc -l
707
That's 707 brownie points I lost, but we really didn't want all that stuff
in the permanent record.
