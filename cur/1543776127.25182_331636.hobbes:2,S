Anyone can patch devices drivers. High performance drivers suffer the most 
from wrong node placement. These are most likely 10G ethernet, high speed 
scsi etc.
The main concern at this point are the higher abstraction layers. These 
are generic and if they do the right thing then we have already come a 
long way.
