I had an 2.0.37 oops. The box in question has been very reliable in the
past (with 2.0.36 and 2.0.37). The only hitch was that I had to reboot
once because an oracle process went into state in which it couldn't be
killed even with kill -9.
Other than that, no problems; uptimes even more than a year.
A couple a days ago the box crashed, however. Before I noticed, it had
already booted, and the only thing I found in the logs was this:

Of course, ksymoops wont get much out of that:

Vanilla 2.0.37, Ppro200, 3C905. Nothing fancy.
This doesn't look like a tcp stack bug nor faulty memory...? Could there
still be a bug in 2.0 new_stat/namei?
