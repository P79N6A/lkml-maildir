Yes, just set the feature flag via tune2fs and then run e2fsck on it.
The second e2fsck shown below is just a demonstration of the speedup.
    # tune2fs -O uninit_groups /dev/foo
    tune2fs 1.39.cfs9 (7-Apr-2007)
    Please run e2fsck on the filesystem.
    # time e2fsck -fy /dev/foo
    e2fsck 1.39.cfs9 (7-Apr-2007)
    Group descriptor 0 checksum is invalid.  Fix? yes

The caveats are:
(a) this is a read-only feature, so you can't mount such a filesystem r/w
    on an older kernel.  You can disable it with "tune2fs -O ^uninit_groups"
    and run a full e2fsck on it again.
(b) I don't think there is an official e2fsprogs release with support for this
    feature yet (it's in the pipe, however).
(c) The actual speedup depends on how full the filesystem is, but since ext*
    usually has way too many inodes, it is generally pretty good.
