You are right. If the device is very big, the radix tree could be huge
as well. Maybe the lookup it not that cheap. But the per-device tree
can be optimized too. A simple way I can immediately image is: evenly
split a device into N parts by the sector numbers. For each part, we
maintain a radix tree. Let's do a math. Suppose I have a 32G partition
(2^35 bytes) and each data block is 4K bytes (2^12).  So the partition
has 2^23 blocks. I divide the blocks into 1024 (2^12) groups. Each
group will only have 2^11 blocks. With radix tree, the average lookup
overhead for each tree would be log(2^11) steps. That is 11 in-memory
tree traverse to locate a page. This cost seems to be acceptable. I
don't really measure it though. As to the memory used for maintain the
radix trees, I believe it is trivial considering the memory size of
modern computers.
