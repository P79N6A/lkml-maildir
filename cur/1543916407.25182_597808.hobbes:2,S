Hi Thomas,
Unfortunately, my observation that the patch series:
http://tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.23-rc4/patch-2.6.23-rc4-hrt1.patches.tar.bz2
worked with 2.6.23-rc4 was wrong.  It _sometimes_ works, but usually doesn't
boot, just like 2.6.23-rc4-mm1, 2.6.23-rc6-mm1 and everything in between with
the above patch series applied.  I've also tried:
http://tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.23-rc5/patch-2.6.23-rc5-hrt1.patches.tar.bz2
http://tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.23-rc6/patch-2.6.23-rc6-hrt2.patch
with the same result.
The problematic patch is x86_64-convert-to-clockevents.patch .
Since the boot fails very early, before any messages reach the (VGA) console,
I have no idea what to do next, except for digging in the code.
Greetings,
Rafael
