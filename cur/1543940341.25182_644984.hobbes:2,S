I've changed it to __BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELDS, as suggested by Alexey. The order 
is important. I'll add it to my todo to convert it to bitmasks.

Removed, and converted to plaintext as suggested by others.

Found a few of them and fixed.

The options are intended for debugging. Normal user does not need to tweak 
them. Adjusted the description to reflect their debugging purpose.
