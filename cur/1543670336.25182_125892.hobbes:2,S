Perhaps this:
Using FTP to connect to another secured computer which has only that
service running.
Write-only (no read, etc) is what is used to send to it. This file will
remain open until time X.
Where X equals when that file will close and another file will begin.
Random names or perhaps based on date/time.
Everything Y amount of time, it will burn to a CD that directory or
perhaps only new files added. (all but the last file which is currently
open)
When that directory (minues the open file) size hits a certain size, it
will either ask for another CD or auto-create another CD and move
previous logs there. (or perhaps when that directory hits a certain size
it moves the old logs there and then burns them instead of every Y time)
Any suggestions/flames?

Hmm, true or not... Better safe than sorry. :-) If that person knows
about
It they are bound it try and figure something out.
Perhaps if you see a massive directory size difference (increased size)
That might be something to set it off... (assuming you follow the idea
above)

Aren't you concerned with all of the trees that will be cut down to make
that paper, though?
I think 1 tree = about 50 reams.  Let's say you get through a ream a
day, that's a tree every couple of months!
Maybe there is a way to encode the data in the rings of the tree while
it's still growing, that would be the ultimate WORM device :-) :-) :-).
