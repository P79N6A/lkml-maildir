Ok, well, if you prefer this way it's ok with me too ;) Though for
sanity, it would have made sense then to breakup the request type into
a major type (BIO, INTERNAL, POWER, ...) and a minor that is major-type
dependant (READ/WRITE/BARRIER for BIO, TASKFILE,ERROR,... for INTERNAL,
and SUSPEND/RESUME for POWER for example).
