Sure we could do all of this, but does OOM really happen that
often that we want to make the algorithm this complex ?
The current algorithm seems to work quite well and is already
at the limit of how complex I'd like to see it. Having a less
complex OOM killer turned out to not work very well, but having
a more complex one is - IMHO - probably overkill ...
