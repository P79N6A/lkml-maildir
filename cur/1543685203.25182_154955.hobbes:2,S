Subject: [PATCH] Lirc Drivers for 2.5/6 20030806 [devfs enabled]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is the fifth try for the lirc patch, and fixes a big problem, the
missing of devfs suppor in the previous patches.
Download it from here
http://flameeyes.is-a-geek.org/lirc/patch-lirc-20030806.diff.bz2
 .
I have switched to gentoo this week (after a rootfs failure on my debian
box), so the devfs suport was the priority.
I also merged another change to lirc_dev from lirc cvs.
Please note that using devfs you need to provide lircd the path to the
device (-d /dev/lirc/lirc0).
Thanks,
