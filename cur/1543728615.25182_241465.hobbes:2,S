Isn't that what the quirk list is for?

That works for my box, but what about for others?  Like those who may 
have both a multi-lun device and a single-lun device that hangs on a 
non-zero lun?  What about the average luser who can't be bothered to 
hack-up his startup scripts or *gasp* rebuild his kernel?
It seems like the quirk list is there for a reason.  If we start 
rejecting certain devices, then what is the criteria for a device to 
actually make it on the list?
