In the case of XFS, I've repaired maybe two dozen (or so) corruptions
that might be non-trivial (in most of the cases, the filesystem
wouldn't even mount before the repair).

BTW, I actually have a test filesystem here (an e2image from an actual
filesystem I encountered once) that used to cause e2fsck 1.36/1.37 to
segfault. Strangely, more ancient versions (like what ships in Red Hat
7.2) were able to repair it without segfaulting. In a few days, once
other stuff calms down for me, I need to revisit that and see if the
bug still exists with 1.39.
