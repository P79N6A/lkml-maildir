I had to refresh my memory with a quick Google search that netted [1]
(look for "Disable interrupts during context switch").  Actually, it
wasn't really a deadlock, but rather a livelock, since a CPU got stuck
on an infinite page-not-present loop.
Fundamentally, the issue was that doing the switch_mm() and
switch_to() with interrupts enabled opened a window during which you
could get a call to flush_tlb_mm() (as a result of an IPI).  This, in
turn, could end up activating the wrong MMU-context, since the action
of flush_tlb_mm() depends on the value of current->active_mm.  The
problematic sequence was:
1) schedule() calls switch_mm() which calls activate_context() to
   switch to the new address-space
2) IPI comes in and flush_tlb_mm(mm) gets called
3) "current" still points to old task and if "current->active_mm == mm",
   activate_mm() is called for the old address-space, resetting the
   address-space back to that of the old task
Now, Ingo says that the order is reversed with his patch, i.e.,
switch_mm() happens after switch_to().  That means flush_tlb_mm() may
now see a current->active_mm which hasn't really been activated yet.
That should be OK since it would just mean that we'd do an early (and
duplicate) activate_context().  While it does not give me a warm and
fuzzy feeling to have this inconsistent state be observable by
interrupt-handlers (and, in particular, IPI-handlers), I don't see any
problem with it off hand.
