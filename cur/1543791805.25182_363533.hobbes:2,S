Turns out that "remove if not supported" is impractical; I did have
that implemented, and backed it out as I got deeper into testing.
For one example, the "can wakeup" for USB devices is a function of what
configuration the device is in ... so a device with two configurations
(call them #5 and #42) as well as "unconfigured" (config #0) might
not support wakeup in two of its three states; maybe only #42 supports
remote wakeup.
Yes, those empty files bothered me a bit too.
