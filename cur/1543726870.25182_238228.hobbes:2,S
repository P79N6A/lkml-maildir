Oh, you wanted the version that compiles!?!  ;)  Besides me being really
bad at counting dots, our lab was down for a bit and I didn't test or
compile that before I sent it.  I was sending it more as an RFC than a
patch destined for acceptance (yet).  I still don't have access to a
machine to test it on, but I hope to snag some time soon.  Glad to see
*someone* is reading my code, though, since it obviously isn't me! ;)
