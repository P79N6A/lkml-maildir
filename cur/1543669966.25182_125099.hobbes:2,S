Only if you're REALLY REALLY sure that you're never going to boot a
kernel that doesn't have the pdflush daemon functionality in it.  This
might be an issue if you still need to boot a 2.2 kernel (I think 2.4
has had the pdflush stuff in it since 2.4.mumble).  I'm sure somebody
can give a definitive answer when pdflush became mainline kernel....
