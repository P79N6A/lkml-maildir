The *idea* of udev et al is that the kernel finds the devices,
/sbin/hotplug loads the driver etc.
This does not cover the class of things which are entirely created by
the driver (eg. dummy devices, socket families), so cannot be
"detected".  Many of these (eg. socket families) can be handled by
explicit request_module() in the core and MODULE_ALIAS in the driver.
Some of them cannot at the moment: the first the kernel knows of them
is an attempt to open the device.  Some variant of devfs would solve
this.

Yes.  This could be changed to probe by device name, not number
though.  And most names can't be dynamic: /dev/null has certain, fixed
semantics.
The "I found this hardware, who will drive it?" mechanism of udev, and
the "User asked for this, who will supply it?" mechanism of kmod have
some overlap, but I think both will end up being required.
Cheers,
Rusty.
