I now know where the wpa_supplicant part is and once I find the matching
patch for Prism54 driver, I'll send them both to you.

You may have seen only two drivers, but actually I'm already aware of at
least seven drivers that work with wpa_supplicant.. All of these are not
yet available publicly, though.
I believe that the current design for wpa_supplicant is quite alright
for most cases. I would like to give some more thought for the roaming
part (i.e., consider giving more control for the driver), but this
should be doable in a backward compatible way without breaking support
with existing code.
