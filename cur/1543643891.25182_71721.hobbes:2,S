Let me make sure I read what you said correctly. Does this mean that Linux
2.4 (or 2.5) kernels do not lock shared memory regions if a process uses
mlockall?
If not, that is *really bad* for our real time applications. We don't want
to take a page fault while running some 80hz task, just because some
non-real time application tried to use what little physical memory we allow
for the kernel and all other applications.
I asked a related question about a week ago on linux-mm and didn't get a
response. Basically, I was concerned that top did not show RSS == Size when
mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE) was called. Could this explain the
difference or is there something else that I'm missing here?
Thanks.
