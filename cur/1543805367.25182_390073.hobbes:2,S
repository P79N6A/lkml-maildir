I totally agree thats what it looks like, but unless I'm missing
something e100_up will take care of everything, and if the interface
is not up, e100_open->e100_up afterward will take care of it.
we have to be really careful about what might happen when resuming on
a system with a SMBUS link to a BMC, as there are some tricky
transitions in the hardware that can be easily violated.
