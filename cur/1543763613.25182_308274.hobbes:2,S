You can also use globally static variables too. But this makes for
non-reentry code.
Sometimes I don't feel that a kmalloc is worth it, and if the function
in question for the driver would seldom have problems with reentry, I
use a statically defined global, and protect it with spin_locks. If
these can also be used in interrupt context, you need to use the
spin_lock_irqsave variants.  But don't do this if the critical section
has long latencies.
