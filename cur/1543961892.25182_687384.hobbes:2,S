There should be nothing in 2.6.x-rc1 which wasn't in 2.6.x-mm1!
_anything_ which appears in 2.6.x-rc1 and which wasn't in 2.6.x-mm1 was
snuck in too late (OK, apart from trivia and bugfixes).
If we decide that we need to fix the oh-shit-lets-slam-this-in-and-hope
problem then I expect we can do so, via fairly relible means.
But the first attempt at solving it should be to ask people to not do that.
