Windows _is_ really worse. In the history of computer software, there
has never been a more poorly designed, more poorly performing, nor
more unreliable operating system than Windows, including Win/2000.
It is the "operating system for the masses", designed to change computers
into "personal communications devices" so that the average person can
surf the Internet. It has no place in a computer designed to perform
important tasks related to Engineering, Mathematics, Business or anything
else that could affect safety or economics.
Since Windows is a major player, but a poor performer, persons who
use computers for Engineering applications and other computing purposes
can take advantage of the technology advances necessary to support such
a poor performing operating system. You do this by running any operating
system _except_ windows.
Cheers,
