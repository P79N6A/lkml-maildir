Hi,
how can I make it work? The BIOS recognizes the drive
(jumpered as master) but 2.6.3-mm2 does not. Device id is 0x3373.
pdc202xx_new, pdc202xx_old and sata_promise drivers
are compiled in. Motherboard is an MSI K8T Neo FIS2R.
The 120GB Samsung and the Sony CRX300E DVD/CDRW combo
are recognized by both the BIOS and the kernel.
