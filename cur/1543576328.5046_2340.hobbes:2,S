Yes, I noticed your implementation a few weeks back.
'fraid I never liked the use of the TASK_EXCLUSIVE bit in
task_struct.state.  It's an enumerated state, not an aggregation
of flags.  Most of the kernel treats it as an enumerated state
and so will happily clear the TASK_EXCLUSIVE bit without masking it
off.  Fragile.
If a task is on two waitqueues at the same time it becomes a bug:
if the outer waitqueue is non-exclusive and the inner is exclusive,
the task suddenly becomes exclusive on the outer one and converts
it from wake-all to wake-some!
Is it faster?  Not sure.  You've saved a cacheline read in __wake_up
(which was in fact a preload, if you look at what comes later) at the
cost of having to mask out the bit in current->state every time
we schedule().
Anyway, it's academic.  davem would prefer that we do it properly
and move the `exclusive' flag into the waitqueue head to avoid the 
task-on-two-waitqueues problem, as was done in 2.4.  I think he's
right.  Do you?
