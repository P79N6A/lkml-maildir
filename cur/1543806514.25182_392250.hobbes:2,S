I've already provided feedback on this a year or so ago - and it
annoys me that absolutely _nothing_ has happened as a result.
The quoted part of this patch is WRONG and will _NEVER_ be merged.
You must NOT enable the clock until the power is stable.  Maybe
this is a cause of the problems that you're seeing with various
cards, since you're not allowing them to reset correctly?
Fix this first, then re-test to see if every other fix you have
is actually necessary.
Sorry, but not following the power up protocol invalidates all other
testing wrt card initialisation behaviour.
