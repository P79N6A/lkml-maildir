Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Cleanup of mtd->type and mtd->flags
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Currently, there appears to be a great confusion surrounding mtd->type
and mtd->flags.  Various combinations of type and flags are used by
device drivers to give some hints to users.  Some users interpret
these hints as seems to be intended by the drivers, others don't.
Mismatches are caused by both drivers and users being confused and the
whole system being less than clear.
This patchset is part of a larger work trying to clean things up.
Patches are fairly simple and shouldn't need any discussion.
