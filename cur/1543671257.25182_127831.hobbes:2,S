I also encounterd similar problems on several servers.
Disabling IO_APIC on uni-processor machine "fixed" things for me.
Could you recompile a kernel without IO-APIC?
I've found these problems also in 2.5.xx kernels.
My wild guess is that certain motherboards/bioses don't do what
they are supposed to do. Found problems both on AMD and P4 platforms.
