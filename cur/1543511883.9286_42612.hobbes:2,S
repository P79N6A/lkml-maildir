  This one is bad. It means the client decided that a dentry was
  stale, because the inode was judged to be stale. This is almost
  always the wrong thing to do. The server will tell us if the
  dentry's filehandle is truly stale.
  I want to get rid of this, and have already put out a tentative
  patch on l-k. Won't be fixed until 2.2.14 at the earliest though.

  Obsolete message. To be removed...

  Obsolete.
