deterministic for you :)
What hotplug will do is allow you to assign a /dev entry to a specific
device, so that you can go off of the topology, and not just the order
in which the devices are found.  That is how this problem will be
solved properly.

No, it's not needed for this problem.  There has been talk of
serializing stuff in userspace, which is the proper way to handle some
of the remove before add was seen problems.
