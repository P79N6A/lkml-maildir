OK ... that's the mistaken assumption.  kernel/smp.c is not subarch
generic, it's APIC specific.  So all apic using subarchs, which is
pretty much everything except voyager, use it.  Since voyager uses
vic/qic based smp harness, it has its own version of this file (in fact
voyager has a completely separate SMP HAL).
