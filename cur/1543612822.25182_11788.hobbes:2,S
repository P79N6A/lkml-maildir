With both these fixes applied cdrecord hangs for 30 seconds, then spits
out "cdrecord: No such device or address. Cannot send SCSI cmd via ioctl",
a couple of hundred times.
In the from dmesg from the same time I get.
------
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hdc: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: drive not ready for command
scsi: device set offline - command error recover failed: host 0 channel 0
id 0 lun 0
------
So no joy yet. :/
