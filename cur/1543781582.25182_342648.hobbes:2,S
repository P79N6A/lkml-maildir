I have some other issue with a MGA card (don't know exactly which, I have only 
access to this on the weekend). With rc5 and rc6 kdm will not start on 
bootup, X complains about some unresolved symbols in the X mga driver. If I 
log in as user and do startx it works fine, also if I switch back to 
2.6.12-rc-something. Something seems to confuse X somehow.
It's a PII-350 with more or less SuSE 9.3. The machine has no net access, so I 
can only try to narrow it down to one rc at the weekend.
