(I'm not currently subscribed to the kernel mailing list, please CC any
replies to my account.)
I've been trying hibernate on my Sony Vaio R505E using Software Suspend.
I'm using the following command:
echo -n "disk" > /sys/power/state
The basic suspend/resume seems to be working now (after many failed
attempts at the past). 
However, there are still a few problems...
I'm using Fedora Core 3 with the fedora kernel 2.6.10-1.770 kernel,
rebuilt to enable software suspend (and USB suspend). At some point,
I'll be trying the software suspend 2 patch to see how far that can get
me. Attached is the output of my syslog after the resume.
My wireless adapter doesn't work on resume. It's a built-in using the
orinoco_cs driver. I get the following messages in /var/log/messages:
Apr  3 13:07:12 localhost kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed
out
Apr  3 13:07:12 localhost kernel: eth1: Tx timeout! ALLOCFID=00c0,
TXCOMPLFID=00bf, EVSTAT=808b
I also get a bunch of messages about usb problems, though I don't have a
USB device connected at the time:
Apr  3 13:07:25 localhost kernel: usb 3-1: 05-wait_for_sys timed out on
ep0in
Apr  3 13:07:25 localhost kernel: usb 3-1: khubd timed out on ep0in
Apr  3 13:07:30 localhost kernel: usb 3-1: khubd timed out on ep0in
Apr  3 13:07:30 localhost kernel: usb 3-1: string descriptor 0 read
error: -110
... and so forth...
Finally, trying to use 3D fails after resuming (Intel 830 using the i915
DRM module). glxgears gives this error: "intelWaitIrq: drmI830IrqWait:
-16" and syslog has "Apr  3 20:29:53 localhost kernel:
[drm:i915_wait_irq] *ERROR* i915_wait_irq: EBUSY -- rec: 0 emitted: 5".
After restarting X, 3D works as usual.
If there's any further debug or investigation I can do, or any tricks to
try, lemme know. I'll try out Software Suspend 2 when I get a chance.
