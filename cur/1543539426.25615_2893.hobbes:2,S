The question becomes: if an invaild IDE command is sent from userspace,
are the programs broken, or is the kernel? In this case, I think there
kernel is broken. It provides a method of communicating with ATA disks
using the ATA specification. However, if you give it the wrong input, it
will violate that specification. This behavior is wrong, and although the
invalid request originated in userspace, it is the kernels job to identify
it as invalid and refuse to send the command.
To carry on the networking metaphor, imagine writing an app that tries to
write() on a unconnected socket, and when you ran it as root it
would cause your kernel to panick. Fixing this would not be considered an
"added layer of protection against broken apps", it would be considered a
bug fix. This is only different in that the interface is used less often,
and misuse can cause more damage.
Andre, do you have any idea how much space this will take up in the
kernel? I have no idea how advanced the heuristics will have to be...

Yes, I totally agree
