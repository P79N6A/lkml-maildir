Folks,
I'm running a Debian-based (Slink 2.1) Alcor (Alphastation 600 5/300) on
kernel 2.2.5-ac4 and am seeing this stuff on kern.log....
It is mounting a volume from another host 192.168.34.20. This other host
is definately ping'able, so it is not a network problem...
Portmapper, rpc is working, nis is working....
Any ideas anybody?
