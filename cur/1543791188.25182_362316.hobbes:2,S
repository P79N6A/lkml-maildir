Subject: Oops! Forgot [PATCH 0/20] inflate cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[Just realized that my 0/20 description didn't go out, so here it is.
I'll wait a bit more before respinning the set with feedback.]
This is a refactored version of the lib/inflate.c I posted about a
year ago. It has a few end goals:
- clean up some really ugly code
- clean up atrocities like '#include "../../../lib/inflate.c"'
- drop a ton of cut and paste code from the kernel boot
- move towards making the boot decompressor pluggable
- move towards unifying the multiple inflate implementations
- save space
This touches 11 architectures, which makes things slightly
interesting. Rather than break the patches out by arch, I've gone the
route of making a number of small incremental changes that sweep
across the tree. Patches that touch the per-arch code are marked
"(arch)".
I've been primarily testing this on x86, but various versions of this
code have gotten testing on a variety of architectures as part of my
linux-tiny tree.
