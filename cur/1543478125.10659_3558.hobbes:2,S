'make config' allows the user to choose [Y] for joystick support
and [M] for all joystick types as modules. Yet none of the
needed symbols from joystick.o are exported. When made in this
manner, the joystick driver modules won't load due to unresolved
symbols. We either need to export the symbols when joystick.o
is compiled into the kernel, or disallow this config option.
