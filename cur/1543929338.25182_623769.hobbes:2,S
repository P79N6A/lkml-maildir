Andi, may I respectfully submit that you're not understanding real users here?
Real users either:
  -  Never look at their syslog
  -  Or look, and aren't terribly scared by what's in there.
Perhaps I'm wrong, and you can point to a message on lkml where
someone has posted a backtrace with fear in their voice.
