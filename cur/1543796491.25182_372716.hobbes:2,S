In the 2.6.15-rc5 kernel we find:
data@amazon linux-2.6.15-rc5]$ find . -name *.[chS] | xargs grep -n "All 
rights reserved" | wc -l
932
[data@amazon linux-2.6.15-rc5]$ find . -name *.[chS] | xargs grep -n 
"Copyright" | wc -l
15083
But I do wonder how copyright and GPL can co-exist. Do the copyright 
holder own the changes anybody else does to the code?
Anyone care to explain?
Thanks
Richard Knutsson
