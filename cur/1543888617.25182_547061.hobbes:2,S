I've found what is going on here - kmem_alloc() is decidedly more
forgiving than manually built page arrays and vmap/vunmap. Prior
to this change we wouldn't have even leaked memory....
Christoph - this is an interaction with xfs_buf_associate_memory();
I'm not sure what it is doing is at all safe now that it never gets
passed kmem_alloc()d memory - it works for the log recovery case
because we use it in pairs - once to shorten the buffer and then once
to put it back the way it was.
But that doesn't work for the log buffers (we never return them to their
original state) and the log wrap case looks to work mostly by accident
now (and could posibly lead to double freeing pages)....
It seems that what we really need with the new code is a xfs_buf_clone()
operation followed by trimming the range to what the secondary I/O needs
to span. This would work for the log buffer case as well. Your thoughts?
In the meantime, the following patch appears to fix the leak.
Cheers,
Dave.
