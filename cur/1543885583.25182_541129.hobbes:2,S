The problem is you print only a random spot (which may not even be right 
one) of one of the involved symbols.
We could actually print out the whole faulty chain, but it would require a 
few changes, which might be useful to improve the select handling.

A symbol can have multiple entries. The "config" line is just the start 
marker for the symbol information, which is the actual relevant part.
