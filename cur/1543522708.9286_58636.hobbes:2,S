With 2.2.15pre3:
2 linux boxes with "identical" cards:
eth0: Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 at 0xfce0, 00:A0:C9:1D:D6:04, IRQ 11.
  Board assembly 352509-003, Physical connectors present: RJ45
  Primary interface chip DP83840 PHY #1.
  DP83840 specific setup, setting register 23 to 8462.
[snip]
While yours was:
eth0: Intel PCI EtherExpress Pro100 at 0xc8037000, 00:90:27:09:24:F8, IRQ 9.
  Board assembly 701738-003, Physical connectors present: RJ45
  Primary interface chip i82555 PHY #1.
I can't see any problem at all (sending a l-k tarball back and forth a few
times). The connection is over a 10/100 switch, I have run both 10 (to a
3c509) and 100 (to the other eepro100).
You mentioned heavy uploads. What exactly is a heavy upload?
