heh.
I guess it helps that more than half a millenium ago the fine folks on 
those islands tried to learn French real hard [by virtue of being 
conquered by the French] - and thus a healthy subset of the English 
language (especially the more newfangled words) has thus become ... erm 
... French? ;-)
Doh, i misspoke. What happened _really_ is that those friendly folks let 
the French in as guests, and during that time of mutual understanding the 
French learned and adopted half of the English language - greatly easing 
communication today.
( And apparently there was some mingling with germanic tribes as well,
  a few thousand years before that. Back then those germanic savages were
  taught bits of proper English as well. )
( And then those folks forked their language into a "British" and "US" 
  versions. It is forwards compatible: if you speak British English then
  by definition you can speak US English, but never the other way around.
  US English was then taught to indian tribes - who, tens of thousands of
  years ago, happened to have spoken the same language that the ancestors
  of the germanic tribes spoke. [Or perhaps they spoke ancient Japanese - 
  memories are a bit fuzzy, records incomplete, and the issue is not fully 
  settled yet.] Anyway, it came around in a happy global circle and they 
  all speak English now! ;)
  [ Except the celts, who insist that they were around even sooner than 
    that - starting in the happy times when you could walk on feet from 
    Scotland to Sweden with only a battle axe in your hand, when you 
    could slide stones weighing tons down an ice glacier and ship them to 
    flatland to build funny stone circles - and from whom everyone else
    on this continent learned all the things worth learning. ]
