Actually, drivers should be structured as high priority tasks, at least from
the scheduling point of view. The interrupt handler itself should only do
enough to stop the card from interrupting and then pass control to a
software handler.
Excessive interrupt latency can have a bad effect on kernel performance, and
so can priority inversions. Provided that no characters are lost, are you
sure you want that serial interrupt to prevent your SCSI manager from
running?
Most real time systems already do this sort of stuff, but only from the
schedulers point of view. Although it would be possible to implement memory
protection as well, I am not familiar with any systems that implement memory
protection on device drivers.

Tied to the kernel is a lot different than requiring a recompile for every
kernel patch. It is possible (as in most manufacturers do it) to have a
kernel interface to handle the normal functions required of a device driver.
Putting in a patch on Solaris doesn't require that you then go out and
recompile every device driver on the system. Same goes for HP-UX or AIX.

I agree that the idea of recovering from a driver crash is probably more
than you want to attempt. The type of error would largely determine if the
system even could recover. 
That doesn't mean that there is no reason to provide an opaque and stable
interface between the device driver and the operating system.
