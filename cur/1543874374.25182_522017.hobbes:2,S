It is because bursts above 5.5Gbps cannot be received by the peer. The peer is
only able to receive bursts up to 5.5Gbps whereas the sender is able to burst
up to 9.9Gbps.

it is video transmission encapsulated in RTP over UDP. I do not know whether
there are any other possibilities that would work also on Mac OS or FreeBSD.
