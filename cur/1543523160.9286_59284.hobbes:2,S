The IO classes are the weakest part of Java and are largely a joke since it's
excessively constrained to a very strict OOP model. This has the tendency to
over constrain programming concepts to an oversimplicistic view of IO, therefore
crippling Java in this area.
This might be helpful:

I might be incorrect since I don't track Java any more, but they are just
moving to a select()/poll() IO model now, which is fairly pathetic IMO.
Java in general is an under appreciate technology for it's OOP cleanliness
and modularity, but horribly incomplete in many areas.
