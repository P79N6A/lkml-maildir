Is there any difference, speed-wise, between turning off all events to
listen to with EPOLL_MOD, and removing the file descriptor with
EPOLL_DEL? I had vaguely assumed that the former would be faster
(especially if you might later want to resume listening for events),
although that was just a guess.
