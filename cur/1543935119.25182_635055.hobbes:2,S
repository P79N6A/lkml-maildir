If there's some option I currently can not choose (because of the 
dependencies), I'd like to see *which* dependency (-ies) prohibit that.
If all I see is
  Depends on: NET && INET && NETFILTER && NF_CONNTRACK
I have to manually hunt down which isn't enabled.

So there's no easy way to say "I want that ... aktivate that, that and this 
option as needed", and it recurses through the symbols.
Thank you!
