Yeah, getting Andrew into the picture is a bit different.  Previously,
with bk, I could just have him pull from my trees, and generate a patch
from that.  And actually, with git that would work just as well, so if
you make your git working trees public, he can pull from them and you're
fine.
But with quilt it's different.  That's why I make up a big patch which
is the sum of my individual patches and put them on a public site.
Right now you can see this at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh-2.6/
The patches in that directory are the "rolled up" ones.  The script
there is what I use to build these patches, if you want to do something
like it.
In the patches/ subdir below that one, is a mirror of my quilt patches
directory, series file and all.  That way people can still see the
individual patches if they want to.
Does this help some?  It's all still under flux as to how this all
works, try something and go from there :)
thanks,
