No, it goes like this:
BIOS loads kernel.
Kernel starts init, init runs scripts, etc.
PnP tool loads obsolete config file.
Modules load with obsolete parameters.
Crash.
Even if the boot completes, you may have strange problems that are
hard to figure out.

Linux makes you buy new hardware? That ought to sell...
Yes, Microsoft helped design this. Get over it. Every new PC
and ISA card supports this. Dynamic reconfiguration isn't as
nice as slot-based configuration, but is still quite usable.

It is perfectly reasonable. Would you rather share ISA IRQs?
That _would_ be extremely dangerous. How else to do this?
Kernel internals would change when such a patch is applied,
so that is no issue.
Cheap modern hardware sucks. If you don't like it, _you_ use PCI.
