Grmb, I should fix that definition.
No, it should still be SMP but the definition is awkward.  I need to state
that really, when I refer to "lock" I mean that I'm talking about raw spin
locks.  So it mainly protects SMP code, but also UP by disabling
preemption.  So I'm talking about a normal spin_lock.
I wrote this document generically so that it works for both the vanilla
kernel when talking about the PI of futexes, as well as when talking about
the -rt patch with its kernel mutexes.  In the -rt patch, spin locks turn
into mutexes, so I was stumbling over not mentioning spin_locks per se,
but was trying to explain them as just spinning locks.
Anyway, I should rewrite that definition.
Thanks for the feedback,
