Good ... such little consistencies in naming are helpful, when
voluntarily self imposed, without incompatible changes to published
names.

In their earlier cpuset context, "tasks" and "notify_on_release" have
been well known for years.
And breaking actual compatibility, in a way that will break more than
the tiniest set of users, even over one release, should not be done
without both (1) a really good cause, and (2) a plan for migrating
users over a couple of releases to the new interface.

Yeah - I figured you wouldn't risk my wrath changing this in cpusets ;).
Could you please not change them in cgroups, either?

Ok - it does make sense that cpuset specific files, when embedded in the
more general purpose cgroups, are adorned with name prefixes that they
didn't have in the legacy API.  And besides, it is what is -- we released
it, and there's no compelling disaster forcing a change.
But generic cgroup infrastructure files, such as "tasks", have not had
such adornments.  And now, that is what it is -- released, and sufficient
to remain as it is.

Good (and extra credit for saying so with fewer words and more politely
than I managed ;).
