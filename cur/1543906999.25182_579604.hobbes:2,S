I am trying to suspend-to-disk using the Suspend2 modules. I am using an SSD drive connected through a SAS bus interface. The SSD acts as a boot disk.
All read and write transactions to the drive works well during normal operation.  
when I hibernate (suspend-to-disk).
I get the following errors:
------------------
mptbase: ioc0: ERROR – Invalid IOC facts reply, msgLength=0 offset=6
pnp: Failed to activate device 00:09.
pnp: Failed to activate device 00:0a.
------------
Immediately after these messages, Linux hangs as soon as it starts writing the image to the drive. showing the following output.
------------------
Writing Kernel and process data ...

------------------
When using KDB to trace the problem after the kernel hung.
<ps> shows a running process: Ks2io
when doing Back Trace for Ks2io wheen the kernel hangs, I get the following trace

--------------------
It seems that the problem is when suspend2 tries to write to the SSD drive.
I am not sure whether the problem is with the suspend2 module or the mpt driver? 
I am using kernel 2.6.21.1 x86_64 with fedora core 5 x86_64. MPT driver 3.04
Any insights/recommendations will be greatly appreciated.
