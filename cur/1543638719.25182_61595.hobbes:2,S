I think the possibility at least for memcpy is rather remote. Any sane
SSE memcpy would only kick in for really big arguments (for small
memcpys it doesn't make any sense at all because of the context save/possible
reformatting penalty overhead). So only people doing really
big memcpys could be possibly hurt, and that is rather unlikely.
But your point stands, one definitely needs to be very careful with it.
Also for special things like UML who can ensure their environment is sane it 
could be still an useful optimization. I did it originally for async IO 
handling in some project. At least offering the choice does not hurt.
If it wcould speed up UML I think it would be certainly worth it.
After all Linux should give you enough rope to shot yourself in the foot ;)

In theory you could do a superhack: put the FP context into an unmapped
page on the stack and only save with lazy FPU or access to the unmapped
page. Unfortunately the details get too nasty
(where to find the unmapped page? is the tlb manipulation worth it if the
page was mapped? how to store the address of the unmapped page for nested 
signal handlers for the page fault handler?) so I discarded this idea.
