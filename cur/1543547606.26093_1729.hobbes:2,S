I'd love to see this transferred to kiobufs, I'd prefer not to see yet
another structure introduced ;-)
At OLS we discussed a design for this, I think the consencus was to
keep the data field in the old skb and allow this to be used by the
old driver (receive path) and for building headers for tx
packets. Then one can either optionally do a linearized skb with
everything in the data field for the old hardware or stick pointers to
data in a kiobuf.
I set up a mailing list for these discussions at
linux-fastio@sunsite.auc.dk (linux-fastio-request@sunsite.auc.dk) to
subscribe. It's been fairly quiet so far, but I'd like to see more
action.
Ok, I'll go read your code next.
