  A funny detail.  CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y makes kernel.org 2.6.9 refuse
rlogin and telnet connections, I suppose because of problems with pty
allocations.  Cannot find any debug anywhere about this.  Ssh and console
logins work.  So I cannot enable CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB.  Will proceed with
2.6.9 though.  I'll report when it hangs if it hangs.
