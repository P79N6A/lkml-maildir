As of the more recent kernels (2.4.0-test8,7,6 for sure) both my IDE and SCSI CD-ROM drives 
will not mount a disk.  They fail and tell me that there is no disk in the drive.  I booted into an old 
2.0.36 kernel just to make sure it wasn't a strange hardware failure and the CD mounted fine.  I 
have attached my .config and dmesg, which shows that the drives are recognised.  If there is 
any further information that I can give, I would be happy to.  Thanks in advance for any help.
