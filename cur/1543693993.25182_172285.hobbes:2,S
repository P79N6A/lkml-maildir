I have some problems with one NIC. Due to lack of time as an 
workaround I'd like to wait for the kernel message "NETDEV WATCHDOG: 
eth0: transmit timed out" and ifconfig down/up the NIC.
How can I trigger any action by such a kernel message? Do I have to 
grep the kernel log?
Mit freundlichen Gruessen/Best regards,
