A year ago I was having a similar problem and I wrote a little extension
to the magic sys request key so I could do this sort of thing.  Basically it's
just a parallel port driver that lets you use the parport to repeatedly tap in
requests by shorting a pin to ground.  The keyboard was dead and this let me
sync disks and reboot.  It shouldn't be hard to extend it to interact with a
kernel debugger.  It's an old patch..I can check that it works in 2.2
and 2.3 if you want it.  Just let me know.
