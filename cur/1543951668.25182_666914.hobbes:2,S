This patch looks bogus.
Why do you introduce a "dev->is_added" field that apparently has to match 
the old "list_empty(&dev->global_list)" 1:1 anyway?
In other words: when is it *ever* permissible for "is_added" to have a 
different value from the "list_empty(..)" logic? And if they must always 
match (and it looks like they have to, since you set and clear the flag 
exactly when you add/remove it from the list), then what exactly is this 
supposed to fix?
