This is the (latest) BIOS update 
http://www.asus.com.tw/products/Motherboard/bios_s370.html#cuv4x-d
I don't see any information about the VIA694XDP Chipset that I have
I am not very sure about updating this bios. If it would say
"This BIOS update fixes some VIA chipset bugs" then okay but now..
blindly installing a new bios :-\ I don't know..
Is there another way to get around this problem ? I don't have
any problems with the fact that I have to use "noapic" but I do have
problems with the fact that at this moment, with a 2.2.x kernel I
get "stuck on TLB IPI wait" errors and on a 2.4.x the system hangs
when switching console to X.
