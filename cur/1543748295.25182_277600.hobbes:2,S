do_anonymous_page() is a relatively compact function at this point. 
This would probably be a lot more readable if it was broken out into at
least another function or two that do_anonymous_page() calls into.  That
way, you also get a much cleaner separation if anyone needs to turn it
off in the future.  
Speaking of that, have you seen this impair performance on any other
workloads?
