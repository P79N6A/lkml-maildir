Thats something you will never achieve. Virtual memory is about heuristics,
crystal ball gazing and guesswork. There are always some workloads where you
want little caching and some where you want lots of caching - such as a 
fileserver.
You can make it right for most people but the last few percent you
will always get by tuning knobs - either directly or via GUI tools like
