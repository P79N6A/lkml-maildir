Not Vojtech, but here is goes... Not everyone has USB compiled in and
even then I think USB is registered after serio. So when we probe for
i8042 BIOS still has its dirty hands on USB controllers and pretends
that they are in fact PS/2 devices. Crazy stuff like that... That's
why we can't keep that code in HCI drivers.
