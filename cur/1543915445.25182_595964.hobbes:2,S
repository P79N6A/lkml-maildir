not at the moment - Antoine suggested that the workload is probably fine 
and the patch against -rc6 would have no clear effect anyway so we have 
nothing to merge right now. (Note that there's no "older behavior" 
possible, unless we want to emulate all of the O(1) scheduler's 
behavior.) But ... we could still merge something like that patch, but a 
clearer testcase is needed. The JVM's i have access to work fine.
