For most cases, yes.  There are basically three corruption cases ---
b_this_page leads us to an oops, an infinite loop, or a loop including a
bogus page.  Trapping the b_this_page ring walks to trap on any bad
b_page would help in the latter two cases, but if we're always getting
the first case, just extending the existing debug patch would be fine.
