Then we still get the inconsistency of device names changing as drivers
are loaded.  I think we should declare it a bug for devices to not be
on a bus.  The only example I have of devices not-on-a-bus are scsi
targets.  I would propose introducing a new scsi_target bus for them,
then removing the 'target' from the start of the bus_id.  Adding them to
the scsi bus looks like it'd be a lot of work.
