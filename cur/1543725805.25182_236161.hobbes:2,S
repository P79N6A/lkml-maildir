If an attacker has some means to put a file on the encrypted hard disk,
I'm not considering it a big breakthrough if he can find out the
position of that file. I'm sure this information can be gained by
forensic block access pattern analysis anyway.

I'm starting to wonder why this is called an attack. The results of this
``attack'' can't be used in any way. In the worst case, a cipher
text/plain text pair can be obtained. I'm repeating it one more time:
ciphers are designed to resist further attacks steaming from known-plain
text attacks.
Have a look at 
http://clemens.endorphin.org/OnTheProblemsOfCryptoloop
 . That's an
attack!

I'm sorry, I consider this useless information.
