I think it's fundamental to any case where two containers share the use
of the page, but either one _can_ be charged but does not receive a
_full_ charge for it.
I don't think it's uniquely associated with first-touch schemes.
The software zones approach where there would be a set of "shared" zones
would not have this problem, because any sharing would have to occur on
data on which neither one was being charged.
