Here are some two USB patches and one PCI Hotplug patch for the
2.6.12-rc6 tree.  They are all bugfixes.  I've put them all in one repo
to make it easier for you to pull from :)
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
Full patches will be sent to the linux-usb-devel and linux-kernel
mailing lists, if anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
