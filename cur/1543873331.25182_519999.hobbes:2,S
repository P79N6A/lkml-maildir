Andi, the current ways do *not* work just fine. 
I don't understand why you have problems with obvious cleanups. You also 
nack'ed the file movement to at least make this kind of thing consistent 
(ie the header file movement in commit 2272b0e03) to  at least only have 
symlinks pointing one way.
The current situation is horrible. We've had bugs simply because people 
didn't even *realize* that a file in arch/i386/ was also used by x86-64.
