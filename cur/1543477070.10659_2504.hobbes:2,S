   In my opinion C++ can be used as cleaner and safer C.
   C++ has lots of really useful features.
   Features that help catch errors early:
   * const pointers
   * private struct members
   * stricter type checking
   Features that improve code safety:
   * constant variables (safer than #defines)
   * inline funcs (safer than #defines)
We're using const pointers and inline function in the kernel already
(supposed by GCC).  The question then is the rest of the features worth
the conversion cost to C++; I myself am not convinced.
