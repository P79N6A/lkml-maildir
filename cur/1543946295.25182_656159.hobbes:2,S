Ingo, a comment in slub.c explains it :
/*
 * The SLUB_FASTPATH path is provisional and is currently disabled if the
 * kernel is compiled with preemption or if the arch does not support
 * fast cmpxchg operations. There are a couple of coming changes that will
 * simplify matters and allow preemption. Ultimately we may end up making
 * SLUB_FASTPATH the default.
 *
 * 1. The introduction of the per cpu allocator will avoid array lookups
 *    through get_cpu_slab(). A special register can be used instead.
 *
 * 2. The introduction of per cpu atomic operations (cpu_ops) means that
 *    we can realize the logic here entirely with per cpu atomics. The
 *    per cpu atomic ops will take care of the preemption issues.
 */
So there is more coming in the preemption area.

Eventually, I think only CONFIG_FAST_CMPXCHG_LOCAL will be needed (when
the code will support preemption). Therefore, this SLUB_FASTPATH define
seems to be only here temporarily.
I'm looking at the code right now.. more to come.
