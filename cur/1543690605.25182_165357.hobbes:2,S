Subject: [2.6 PATCH] Squelch make mandocs warnings
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hello.
This patch removes the case sensitivity from a bunch of the regular expressions
used to handle docbook tags within the mandocs scripts. It also tweaks the
scripts to use the value of the $TMPDIR environment variable for the location of
temporary files (if set). The default is to still use /tmp.
The patch results in significantly fewer warnings being generated by a "make
mandocs". It's part of an ongoing warning squelching effort.
The patch can also be downloaded from

output at

 although there
should be no visible changes...
Please apply.
Thanks,
Mikal
PS: Oh, and Gordon says hello.
