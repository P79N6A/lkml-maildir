I go through this exact process every time that I release a minor
revision.  I just do it as a single CSET with the comments dispersed
into the individual files that the comments apply to.  If everyone is
really so opposed to using the individual file comment feature of BK,
it will actually make my life easier.  So just let me know what you
do or don't like about the latest CSET that I've committed:
http://linux-scsi.bkbits.net:8080/scsi-aic7xxx-2.5/cset@1.865.2.6?nav=index
.html|ChangeSet@-2d

I think you misunderstood me.  CSETs for 2.4.X have been available since
May of this year.  I again sent them in June.  Then July, etc. etc.
This would have allowed the 2.4.X branch to track almost every minor
revision of the aic7xxx driver.  Now with so much time having passed,
*of course* the changes are large.  From my own experience though, the
smaller changes haven't helped in getting them applied.  But since these
changes are in BK, I suppose the fact that there are now several CSETs
to be applied instead of just one or two doesn't matter much.  The
revision history is there for anyone to review in whatever granularity
they want.
