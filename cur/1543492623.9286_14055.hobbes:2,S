I am looking for some details about kernel threads.
I see kernel_thread defined in arch/whatever/kernel/, 
but I am not totally clear on the details of how it 
works.   Specifically, how is it scheduled?  Is it 
preemptable?  (my guess is no.)
Is there a doc/book available with any details?
thanks.
