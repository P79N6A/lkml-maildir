This function is called in critical paths and it would be very important
to optimize it further.

This only changes when nt_adj changes. Maybe maintain the sum separately?

IA64 does not do remainder processing (maybe I just do not understand
this...) but this seems to be not necessay if one uses 64 bit values that
are properly shifted?

The whole function could simply be:
#define cyc2ns(cycles, ts) (cycles*ts->current_factor) >> ts->shift
