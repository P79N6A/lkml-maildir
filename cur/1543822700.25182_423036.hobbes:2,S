Looks to me like you booted with mem=8m, and these allocations are
failing because every page the page allocator tried to issue were marked
as being reserved.  The SysRq-M output shows that it did try to swap as
it limped along.
My box won't get past a black screen hang with less than mem=24m, so I'm
kinda surprised you got far enough to even add swap.
