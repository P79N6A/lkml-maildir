Heh, you need
  #if defined(CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK) || defined(CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK_MODULE)
Also, another question.  Is there a way to tell whether the device or
port is connected behind a dock or not?  Just notifying hotplug signal
is fine for hotplugging but to make hot unplug safe for PATA, libata
should be able to tell whether the device is actually gonna go away and
kill it explicitly.
Thanks.
