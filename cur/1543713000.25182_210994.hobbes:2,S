yep, i know it - it annoys me too...

there is a patch pending in my tree to allow empty boot options, such
as
	snd-via82xx=,,,,,2
but it doesn't improve so much.
perhaps the better way would be like
	snd-via82xx=enable:1,ac97_quirk:4
??
in this way, it's hard to keep the compatibility with old boot
parameters, but i don't think no one will complain if they see it
nicer.
