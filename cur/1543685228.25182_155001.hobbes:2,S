It makes me wonder what is so special about vxfs that they need
to modify GPL code in order for it to work ...
Not that I'm against this change in principle, but I'd just like
it to be useful for GPL software too, otherwise it'd just be a
hook for non-GPL software and a fine line to a GPL violation.
