Careful there! 2.4.0-test10-pre3 on i686 is the prime suspect in massive
reorganization of / here (had to reinstall several packages, and lost most
of root's account configuration), and it also nibbled at /usr/src (it
screwed up a directory, and I suspect it bit my gcc tree updated daily from
CVS, for which I have a backup).
Sorry, no further data.
