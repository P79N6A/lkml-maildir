Ok, it seems worse than that. I don't see the point of that U64_C thing at 
all.
Those macros are only used in C code. 
The values should have the right C types already (ie "ull" at the end of 
big constants to make sure we don't trigger warnings). And no, we do NOT 
want to have 5 different macro names for five different versions of the 
same macro. That's just insane.
Make the timeconst.h file just contain sane macros. No preprocessor games 
etc. Just make it say
	#define USEC_TO_HZ_MUL32 ..correct-value-here..
and not even generate macros with values that cannot be used (ie >64 
bits).
