My guess is that it is maybe the DRM changes that have done it... the
32/64-bit code in 2.6.13-rc6 may have issues, but they've been tested
on a number of configurations (none of them by me... I can't test what
I don't have...)
Can you do me a favour and check 2.6.13-rc6 with the git-drm.patch from -mm?
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.13-rc5/2.6.13-rc5-mm1/broken-out/git-drm.patch
If this is a 32/64-bit issue I think that patch might help, I'm not
convinced I can't see how the DRM would ever start blanking the
screen, it doesn't have any code in that area at all.. but stranger
things have surprised me...
Is there any difference in your Xorg.0.log files before/after this...
There is also an issue at:
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4965
which was caused by the pci assign resources patch on x86... I'm not
sure if this is similiar..
Dave.
