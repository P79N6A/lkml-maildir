Well at least we know where the port is now - thats too fast for an LPC
bus device, so it must be an SMI trap.
Only easy way to find out is to use the debugging event counters and see
how many instruction cycles are issued as part of the 0x80 port. If its
suprisingly high then you've got a firmware bug and can go spank HP.
