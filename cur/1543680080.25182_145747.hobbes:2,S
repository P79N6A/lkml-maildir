crypto/arch/ sounds like a bad idea.  We really should avoid arch code
outside arch/ and include/asm*.  So arch/<foo>/crypto/ as suggested by
Thomas is much better.

That's a really bad idea.  Think of a i586/i686 optimized assembler
implementaion e.g. using MMX or SSE or whatever.  You'll always need
the generic version as fallback.

Right.  And IMHO this should happen with all optimized version - putting
policy in the kernel to select them sounds like a bad idea, especially
as it could get rather complicated when it involves multiple optimized
and / or hardware implementations.
