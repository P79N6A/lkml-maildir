I can't seem to get 2.4.0-test4 to load modules.  The version mangling
of symbols seems to be wrong for some symbols.  I do not have this
problem with -test3.
For example, with test4 I see:
     nm 3c59x.o: EISA_bus
     /proc/ksyms: EISA_bus_R__ver_EISA_bus (!!!)
     System.map: EISA_bus
With test3 I see:
     nm 3c59x.o: EISA_bus_Rsmp_7413793a
     /proc/ksyms: EISA_bus_Rsmp_7413793a
     System.map: EISA_bus
What's going on?  This was a completely clean build in a virgin tree,
including make mrproper.  Note the bizarre EISA_bus_R__ver_EISA_bus in
/proc/ksyms.
