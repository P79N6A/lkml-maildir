The platform should use whatever is appropriate, and matches
firmware/bios/whatever conventions, to determine this stuff.
On Sparc you get an openfirmware environment variable called
"output-device" that can point to a framebuffer or serial

The user can override this on the kernel command line, of course, and
what they ask for will get translated properly.
