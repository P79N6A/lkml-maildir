There is actually a very simple reason for that, the actual patch is not
my primary focus, for me it's actually more an afterthought of the actual 
design to show that it actually works.
My primary interest is a _discussion_ of the scheduler design, but Ingo 
insists on patches. Sorry, but I don't really work this way, I want to 
think things through _first_, I need a solid concept and I don't like to 
rely on guesswork.
How much response would I have gotten if I had only posted the example 
program and the math description as I initially planned?
bye, Roman
