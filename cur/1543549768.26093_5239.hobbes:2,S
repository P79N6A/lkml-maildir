This is flawed. It's the irq that have to shrink the memory itself. It can't
certainly reschedule kreclaimd and wait it to do the work.
Increasing the free_pages_min limit is the _only_ alternative to having
irqs that are able to shrink clean cache (and hopefully that "feature"
will be resurrected soon since it's the only way to go right now).
