There is a different patch "[PATCH] ppc64: Add mecanism to check existence
of legacy ISA devices" that I posted today that does that for ppc64,
however, Linus seem to prefer something different involving porting
the pnp core to ppc64 and adapting those drivers to rely on it, which
I don't have time to do at the moment.
