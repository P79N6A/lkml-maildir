Well, that's perhaps not entirely true, but they did solve the mysterious
and funny, and not so funny, problems that I was having with Oopses and
filesystem corruption (kernel 2.4.16, 2xPIII/600MHz, PIIX4, XFS).
Is there any reason at all why these patches are not part of the stock
kernel? I mean the kernel just lost a disk of mine: is there any reason
worth a disk of lost data?
