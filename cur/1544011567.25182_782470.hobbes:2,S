Yes, quite so. The design principles are as follows:
The goal of the initrd is to activate and mount the root fs.
And the root fs _only_. Every other system should be configured
once the main system is running.
So mkinitrd has two parts:
a) Detect the configuration of the rootfs and create the
   initramfs
b) Configure the rootfs on boot.
Therefore there are two distinct script types:
setup-XXX.sh - run during initrd creation time to detect
  and record the configuration
boot-XXX.sh - run during boot to configure the subsystem
The setup scripts have these tasks:
- Detect the rootfs
- Unwind the storage stack and record the configuration
  on each level
- Copy the required contents into the initramfs
- Pack initramfs for use
The boot scripts have these tasks:
- Initial configuration (create required device nodes, start udev)
- Configure the storage stack
- fsck and mount the root fs
So basically the boot scripts have to be called in reverse
order to the setup scripts.
To ensure the order is preserved during each run I've
introduced some 'stages', which are run consecutively.
These stages are documented in mkinitrd.5
The neat thing here is that we've split off each
configuration into small scripts, which will be called
if present. This allows for a pretty modular setup
and avoid the massive requirement setting of an
monolithic script.
Cheers,
Hannes
