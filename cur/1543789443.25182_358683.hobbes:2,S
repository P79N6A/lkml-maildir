Can you try vanilla 2.6.14?
If 2.6.14 works, then does 2.6.14-rc4-mm1 with git-acpi.patch backed out work better?:

If 2.6.14 fails, does 2.6.13 work better?

forcing the LAPIC to be enabled when the BIOS didn't enable it
is risky -- you're asserting that you know more
about the hardware than the BIOS writer knew.
Do you still have the issue without the "lapic" boot option?

You're somewhat on your own here since you've replaced the OEM's firmware.
Do you still have the issue without replacing the BIOS?
