Hi,
The Kernel Journal is at
http://www.linuxcare.com/developers/kernel
It tracks this list and extracts announcements of kernel-related projects.
I'm gradually extending the number of projects it is aware of, but it's not
yet complete. I'd really appreciate it if anyone who posts regular on-topic
announcements of kernel related projects, could get in touch with me so I
can include those announcements in Kernel Journal.
So far, the projects included are:
* Encryption HOWTO
* devfs
* devfsd
* Alan's kernel pre-releases
* fairsched
* kernel profiling module
* lvm
* man-pages
* modutils
* nfs-utils
* speakup
* strace
as you can see, it's not even close to complete. Right now I'm keeping very
careful track by eye of everything that comes through the list, so I should
catch anything new that comes in, but any help I get will definitely speed
things up.
Zack
