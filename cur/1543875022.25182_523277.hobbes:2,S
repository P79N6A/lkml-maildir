Hmm, what seems bit worrying is:
diff --git a/mm/slab.c b/mm/slab.c
index abf46ae..b187618 100644
--- a/mm/slab.c
+++ b/mm/slab.c
@@ -389,7 +389,6 @@ struct kmem_cache {
        unsigned int buffer_size;
        u32 reciprocal_buffer_size;
 /* 3) touched by every alloc & free from the backend */
-       struct kmem_list3 *nodelists[MAX_NUMNODES];
I think nodelists is placed at the beginning of the struct for a reason. 
But I have no idea if it actually makes any difference...
