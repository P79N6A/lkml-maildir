 In theory one can do just that on Un*x systems too.  That's why setid
bits can't be set by just anybody.
 What if the program is setuid and executable by a group but not other?
We do this with "su" on servers.
 Now, ACLs I want to see widely supported on Linux, and *used* properly
too.  They've been little used in most environments I've seen even on
systems that do support them, which is a shame as they are a necessary
and useful idea.  Yes, the Un*x permissions system does have some
limitations, but let's not break *all* the existing software and OSs
that use them, since what you're suggesting will not improve things.

 Why is that needed anyway?  By default directories get execute bit set
when they're created, at least in my environment; if you're extending
permissions you can use "go=u" or "o=g" to broaden the permissions, as
I would expect the existing perms to be correct on files vs directories
in most cases.
