That made me do some grepping of my own. Nothing obvious, but this bit
from drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_init.c seems a little odd:
        uint16_t w, mwi;
	...
        /* Reset expansion ROM address decode enable */
        pci_read_config_word(ha->pdev, PCI_ROM_ADDRESS, &w);
        w &= ~PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE;
        pci_write_config_word(ha->pdev, PCI_ROM_ADDRESS, w);
Is the address register really only 16 bits wide on some hw?
