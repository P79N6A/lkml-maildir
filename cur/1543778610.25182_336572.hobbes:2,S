Subject: [PATCH][TRIVIAL] Real-Time Preemption V0.7.51-38: fix compile bug in drivers/block/paride/pseudo.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch, built against kernel version 2.6.13-rc3, fixes a small bug in
drivers/block/paride/pseudo.h which prevents its related drivers from being
compiled successfully when RT patch (version 0.7.51-38) is compiled in.
This is due to the new definition of DEFINE_SPINLOCK macro, which does not
longer accept additional attributes.
