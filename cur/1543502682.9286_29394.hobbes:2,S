I recieve this when I ping with my DEC Multia.  The output of dmesg has
errors saying something like: "Unaligned trap in ping: blah blah".  I get
one "Unaligned trap" message for each packet that I send.  This started to
happen when I upgraded from RedHat 5.2 to RedHat 6.0.  Otherwise the
Multia works ok.  I am using the tulip driver for the ethernet interface.
I have tried the de4x5 driver, it does the same thing.  I have a feeling
that it is a bit up the TCP stack - but I haven't have the ambition to
look further into it.  Right now I am running 2.2.5 on the Multia - I
can't remeber if I tried it with 2.2.10...
