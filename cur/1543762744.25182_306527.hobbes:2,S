There are two cases:
1. NULL is impossible, the check is superfluous
2. this was an actual bug
In the first case, my patch doesn't do any harm (a superfluous isn't a 
real bug).
In the second case, it fixed a bug.
It might be a bug not many people hit because it might be in some error 
path of some esoteric driver.
If a maintainer of a well-maintained subsystem like i2c says
"The check is superfluous." that's the perfect solution.
But in less maintained parts of the kernel, even a low possibility that 
it fixes a possible bug is IMHO worth making such a riskless patch.
