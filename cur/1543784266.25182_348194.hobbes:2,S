(info gcc) says gcc >= 3.1.

A general library function (handling all registers) would have to be
written in assembler because gcc has trouble allocating registers
otherwise; considering that we should ideally avoid BIOS calls and that
such a function wasn't needed in the last 14 years, I don't think it is
worth the effort.
