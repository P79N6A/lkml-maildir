I dont think this is a problem. Cpus numbers and ram size are related, even if 
Moore didnt predicted it;
Nobody wants to ship/build a 4096 cpus machine with 256 MB of ram inside.
Or call it a GPU and dont expect it to run linux :)
99,9% of linux machines running on earth have less than 8 cpus and less than 
1000 ethernet/network devices.
In case we increase the number of cpus on a machine, the limiting factor is 
the fact that cpus have to continually exchange on memory bus those highly 
touched cache lines that contain refcounters or stats.
