Should __daemonize() check this? check if in the arguments
tsk == current or tsk == idle_task. This would prevent people
from using __daemonize() for the wrong things.

|Uhhh... there are many other problems if you are trying to do this on
|a "live" process.  idle process creation is a special case because it
|has never been run yet.
|
|This is not a generic "daemonize this task" mechanism!
