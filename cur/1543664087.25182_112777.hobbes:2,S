FWIW, I think it's not a good idea. Why call it 'required' in the kernel 
when the normal (gcc) expression for it is 'used'. - We didn't rename 
'deprecated' to 'obsolete', either ;)
Also, I don't really see any use for __optional at this point, so why add 
it at all?
So IMO, the only change which possibly makes sense is to rename
__attribute_used__ to __used, since it makes it more consistent with
similar things like __deprecated, __init, __exit etc.
