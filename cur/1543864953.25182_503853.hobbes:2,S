 Thanks for the suggestion - any particular reason ?  That box is
running as 64-bit at the moment, and likely to stay that way for the
rest of this week while it builds userspace, but I'm not averse to
running 32-bit on it again if it serves a purpose.
 However, in the vain hope I can actually get it to log something,
wouldn't it be more useful to continue running _with_ preempt ?
 I'm starting to think it might have been yet another victim of the
solar flares, and the fact it was always running a 32-bit kernel
could have been coincidence.
