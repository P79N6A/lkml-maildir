I now have an arm cross compiler (gcc-4.0.2-glibc-2.3.6
arm-unknown-linux-gnu).  (See the results page at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/branch/9/
 - I must get a better
name/place :-(.)  Is this sufficient to help you out?  What configs would
be useful to build (as Andrew said, they don't take very long each).
I really want as many subsystems as possible in the linux-next tree in an
attempt to avoid some of the merge/conflict problems we have had in the
past.  What can we do to help?
