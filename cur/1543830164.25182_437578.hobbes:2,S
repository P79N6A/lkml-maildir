Hmmm...
Sounds like percpu_alloc() is strongly recommended.  Made the changes,
compiling, hope to test overnight.

Exactly.  ;-)  Been there, done that, gotten it right, but have also
run up almost every blind alley that there is.
Besides, prior to this, there is a synchronize_sched().  In many cases,
the readers will have all completed during the synchronize_sched()
latency, so my bet is that the extra complexity will have no benefit in
the common case.  And if someone comes up with with a good reason to do
a blocking network receive or some such in the SRCU read-side critical
sections, I will be happy to add the wakeup machinations.
Fair enough?
(Besides, we will want to save some of the complexity budget for a
hierarchical implementation should Jesse Barnes prove correct about
future 1,000-CPU dies, right?)

Urg...

To erase it from my mind, I would have had to allow it to get that far
in the first place.  ;-)
