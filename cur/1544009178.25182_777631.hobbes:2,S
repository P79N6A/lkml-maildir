REQUEST FOR COMMENTS ...
Here is a set of two patches + a demo patch to enable recursive processing
of a printf format string in vsnprintf(), which is used by printk().
Specifically, when called like this:
    printk(KERN_INFO "He said: %v, and I said: %s\n", fmt, args, "no");
the format string 'fmt' will be processed using the supplied args ('args'
is a va_list) and the resulting string will be 1 kernel message.
This is useful in functions which sit between kernel code and printk and
prepend or append to a kernel message. For example, from sound/core/misc.c
void snd_verbose_printk(const char *file, int line, const char *format, ...)
{
        va_list args;
        if (format[0] == '<' && format[1] >= '0' && format[1] <= '7' && format[2] == '>') {
                char tmp[] = "<0>";
                tmp[1] = format[1];
                printk("%sALSA %s:%d: ", tmp, file, line);
                format += 3;
        } else {
                printk("ALSA %s:%d: ", file, line);
        }
        va_start(args, format);
        vprintk(format, args);
        va_end(args);
}
Making 2 calls to printk for a single output line is undesirable
because the output is only guaranteed to be contiguous within a
single call to printk. Other code works around this by pre-processing
the format string into its own buffer, like drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c
void cpufreq_debug_printk(unsigned int type, const char *prefix,
                        const char *fmt, ...)
{
        char s[256];
        va_list args;
        unsigned int len;
        unsigned long flags;
        WARN_ON(!prefix);
        if (type & debug) {
                spin_lock_irqsave(&disable_ratelimit_lock, flags);
                if (!disable_ratelimit && debug_ratelimit
                                        && !printk_ratelimit()) {
                        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&disable_ratelimit_lock, flags);
                        return;
                }
                spin_unlock_irqrestore(&disable_ratelimit_lock, flags);
                len = snprintf(s, 256, KERN_DEBUG "%s: ", prefix);
                va_start(args, fmt);
                len += vsnprintf(&s[len], (256 - len), fmt, args);
                va_end(args);
                printk(s);
                WARN_ON(len < 5);
        }
}
(using 256 bytes of stack) and drivers/scsi/arm/fas216.c
fas216_do_log(FAS216_Info *info, char target, char *fmt, va_list ap)
{
        static char buf[1024];
        vsnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), fmt, ap);
        printk("scsi%d.%c: %s", info->host->host_no, target, buf);
}
(using 1024 bytes of stack) and then issuing a single call to printk at
the end. On 4th December Matt Mackall posted a patch to the list which
essentially changed functions like the latter two into a type which
calls printk (or vprintk) 2 or 3 times.
I propose doing away with 2-and-3-printk code by enabling printk's
formatting function (vsnprintf) to process format strings with a '%'
directive (%v at the moment). When processing a format string, if %v
is seen then two arguments will be retrieved: the sub-format and
va_list args. These are used to recurse back into the processing
function, process that format and arguments, and return to the
original format string and continue to process it and its arguments.
With recursion all the formatting is done into the same buffer
(i.e. 1024 byte printk_buf in kernel/printk.c) saving stack space
and eliminating double-handling of the formatted strings.
I'm looking for feedback on this method.
The first patch prepares vsnprintf() by splitting it into two functions;
the inner function is suitable for recursion. The inner function needs
to know buf (start of buffer), str (current position within buffer)
and end (first character beyond end of buffer) at all times. 'buf'
is there because it has to be able to process a %n directive, which
requires calculation of the total number of characters (potentially)
written. The function also needs to be able to recurse into formats
which can't be expanded because they are beyond the end of the buffer,
because it needs to return the total number of characters which 'would
be' written, even if it can't write them.
The second patch adds the recursion on '%v', it's very simple.
The third patch is a sample net_printk() function which shows the
recursion working on a handful of messages from net/socket.c ...
void net_printk(char *level, char *fmt, ...) {
   va_list ap;
   va_start(ap, fmt);
   printk("%sNET: %v\n", level, fmt, ap);
   va_end(ap);
}
The only problem I've come up against so far is that actually using
'%v' causes gcc to warn thusly:
net/socket.c: In function ‘net_printk’:
net/socket.c:183: warning: unknown conversion type character ‘v’ in format
net/socket.c:183: warning: too many arguments for format
I haven't been able to find any way to tell gcc that '%v' is actually
alright and the alternative is to turn off printf format/argument
checking which is also not desirable.
To keep gcc quiet, the problem can be hacked around with another extension
to '%p', however 2 arguments must be taken so the specifier would look
like one of these:
%pV%s       ... printk("%s: %pV%s\n", "NET", args, fmt);
%s%pV       ... printk("%s: %s%pV\n", "NET", fmt, args);
The former one is easier to parse because it won't upset %s parsing
but the arguments look bad. I prefer to see fmt first.
Comments please,
Nick.
