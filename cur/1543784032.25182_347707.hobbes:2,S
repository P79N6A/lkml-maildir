It has to be in some context, otherwise Kconfig can't tell whether it 
belongs to the previous config or stands alone.
At the very last it needs something so it can be internally translated to
config y
	tristate
	allow BLD_DEV_FD
OTOH every arch already defines a "config <arch>", where things like this 
can be added.
