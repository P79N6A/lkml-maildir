Yes, it does mostly - thanks. 
A few questions/nits:
o Did you attempt quantify how many places in the kernel could use this?
  I'm just trying to get a feel for how useful this really is vs just 
  using existing mechanisms (that people understand) to implement a 
  non-SMP-safe counter that protects updates (writes) against interrupts.
  If you did, adding some referencs to local_ops.txt would be helpful
  so folks could look for examples of "correct usage".
o Wording in local_ops.txt: "on the 
	"... it will then appear to be written out of order wrt
	 other memory writes on the owner CPU."
  I'd like to suggest "by the owner CPU".
o How can a local_t counter protect updates (writes) against interrupts 
  but not preemption?
  I always thought preemption required some sort of interrupt or trap.
  Maybe the local_ops.txt explains that and I just missed it.
  DaveM explained updates "in flight" would not be visible to interrupts
  and I suspect that's the answer to my question....but then I don't "feel
  good" the local_ops are safe to update in interrupts _and_ the process
  context kernel.  Maybe the relationship between local_ops, preemption,
  and interrupts could be explained more carefully in local_ops.txt.
o OK to add a reference for local_ops.txt to atomic_ops.txt?
  They are obviously related and anyone "discovering" one of the docs
  should be made aware of the other.
  Patch+log entry appended below. Please sign-off if that's ok with you.
thanks,

Diff+Commit entry against 2.6.22.5:
local_t is a variant of atomic_t and has related ops to match.
Add reference for local_t documentation to atomic_ops.txt.

+local_t is very similar to atomic_t. If the counter is per CPU and only
+updated by one CPU, local_t is probably more appropriate. Please see
+Documentation/local_ops.txt for the semantics of local_t.

 	The first operations to implement for atomic_t's are the
 initializers and plain reads.
