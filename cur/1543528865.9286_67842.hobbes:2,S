Okay, I just have to remember how to connect the dots .........
I am shaking out the GLOBAL blow off of "CONFIG_PCI" by all Maintainers,
this includes myself, in both stable and development kernels.
I have fond most if not all +/- 1 (as always) in IDE, a major safety catch
in NET missing, SCSI and the rest are not scoped out yet.........
ide is much worst than 'net' but fixable......
./drivers/net/Config.in
-   bool '  EISA, VLB, PCI and on board controllers' CONFIG_NET_PCI
+   if [ "$CONFIG_PCI" = "y" ]; then
+      bool '  EISA, VLB, PCI and on board controllers' CONFIG_NET_PCI
+   fi
scsi ......... oh my.........
sound ??
./drivers/*---------- needs to be checked for PCI_CONFIG dependencies...
