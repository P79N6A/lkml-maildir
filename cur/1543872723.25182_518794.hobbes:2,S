This means that one of the notifiers had not returned before you pressed
the button.  Now the question is which one (there are many).
I don't know if there's any nicer way to find out that, but I usually hack
kernel/sys.c:notifier_call_chain() to print nb->notifier_call (as a pointer)
before the call is made.  Then I write down the address of the last one
called before the hang/oops and use gdb to check which function it points to.
Greetings,
