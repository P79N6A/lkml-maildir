That looks like a volatile lvalue to me.  I confess I didn't exactly ace 
compilers.  Care to explain this?

We can't have split stores because we don't use atomic64_t on 32-bit 
architectures.  volatile won't save you from pushing stores out of loops unless 
you're also doing reads.  This is why we use reads to flush writes to mmio 
registers.  In this case, an atomic_read() with volatile in it will suffice. 
Storing twice is perfectly legal here, though it's unlikely that an optimizing 
compiler smart enough to create the problem we're addressing would ever do that.
