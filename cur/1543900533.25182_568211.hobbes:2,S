Sure, the process has /dev/lguest open, so I can do something in the
close routine.  Instead of keeping a reference to the tsk, I can keep a
reference to the struct lguest (currently it doesn't have or need a
refcnt).  Then I need another lock, to protect lg->tsk.
This seems like a lot of dancing to avoid one export.  If it's that
important I'd far rather drop the code and do a normal wakeup under the
big lguest lock for 2.6.23.
Cheers,
Rusty.
