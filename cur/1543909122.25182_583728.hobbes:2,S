CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING is used for the precise accouting of user,system, 
steal and irq time on these platforms and is not what you want for the on/off 
decision.

If you look at the patch I have posted some minutes ago, I use a method 
similar to irq_enter and irq_exit to separate real system time from guest 
time.

We have to make sure that userspace doesnt break, but yes we should have a 
guest time for processes as well.
