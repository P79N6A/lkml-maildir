Hi,
i'm using a linux debian sarge on an encrypted root filesystem with linux 2.6.10-rc2 kernel.
Filesystem is encrypted using dmcrypt, the encryption framework working on top of the device mapper.
I deleted a file and immediatelly i attempted to recover it using debugfs.
Linux aaa 2.6.10-rc2 #1 Wed Dec 1 09:52:37 CET 2004 i686 GNU/Linux
aaa:~# df -k .
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/rootfs     8676440   5278584   2957108  65% /
aaa:~# debugfs /dev/mapper/rootfs
debugfs 1.35 (28-Feb-2004)
debugfs:  lsdel
aaa:~# strings /dev/mapper/rootfs
strings: Warning: '/dev/mapper/rootfs' is not an ordinary file
Unfortunatelly neither with debugfs neither with a rogue strings i can access data on the encrypted filesystem.
I think that device mapper should be modified to allow debugfs checking and to allow access on it like a tradional hard drive.
Regards
