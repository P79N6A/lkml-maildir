Yeah, the darn thing (smbmount) sometimes dies when asked to reconnect.
With--of all things--a SIGPIPE, from trying to print debug output.  I
applied the simple attached patch to samba 2.0.5a, and (after a day or so)
the problem is no more.  It seems to be a simple typo, since if SMBFS_DEBUG
is defined, we just closed the fd we're trying to print to.
I suspect this the problem for lots of people.  If you compiled smbmount
without SMBFS_DEBUG set (the default), and usually see the see the problem
after a period of inactivity (specifically, the second reconnect try by the
kernel fails), and notice that smbmount is dead when the failure happens,
I'd bet this will help.
(I sent this to tridge@samba.org last night and have not heard anything
yet.)
