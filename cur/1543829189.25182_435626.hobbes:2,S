I don't think thats the problem, as I've tracked
the problem to packets being dropped because of
excessive backlog (ie, they are being dropped
gracefully). However with a backlog of 20000, and
a traffic level of about 75,000pps, that means
almost 1/3 of a second that the system doesn't
process packets, which is just unacceptable.
I'll try changing the setting, but running out of
memory doesn't seem to be the issue. I think what
I need is some mechanism to make interrupts a
priority, like it was back in the days when
networking was more important then mp3 playback.
