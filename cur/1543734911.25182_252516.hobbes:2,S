> Do you have a VIA chipset on this system?
Yes, it's a laptop with a k8t800 chipset. But I have some problems with 
the soulution to disable ACPI though it's a laptop and diabling ACPI 
would say no frequency scaling, no fan regulation etc. Does the PM_Timer 
work on amd64 or isn't it just for x86? I think that i had heard about 
that it wouldn't bring any effect on x86-64. We have discussed this 
issue for a long while on the gentoo amd64 forums though it looks like 
that just amd64 users have this problems.
Here a link but without any useful solution, we had the things with 
disabling ACPI or enabling the PM-Timer already.

As I know this problem started with kernels later than 2.6.5, don't know 
the exact version, end ended with kernel 2.6.8 which only reports lost 
ticks > 100 by default. But we still loose ticks and i don't like this 
even if i don't see it anymore on dmesg.
