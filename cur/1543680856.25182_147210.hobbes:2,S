... but it also bloats the code, in this case, in many ways
needlessly.  You don't want to compile out all BUG_ON()'s, just the
ones that wouldn't be checked for anyway.
In fact, have a macro that explicitly tests for nullness by
dereferencing a pointer might be a good idea; on most architectures it
will be a lot cheaper than BUG_ON() (which usually requires an
explicit test), and the compiler at least has a prayer at optimizing
it out.
