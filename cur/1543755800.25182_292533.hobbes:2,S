Yes, the discussion in this area is what is the best way to implement
this requirement.   How much should be in the kernel and how much
should be in user space.
At the moment things are broken but should be fixed shortly.
So what has been implemented are /dev/oldmem which provides access
to the old memory.  And /proc/vmcore which provides both the old
memory and the register information.

There is a fine line there, as a simple ELF core dump has just enough
information to describe discontiguous memory, and to have an out of
band channel for register information.  Adding anything extra like
virtual addresses that match the kernel should be left for the
crash dump analysis tools.
In code that is currently in the mainstream kernel /dev/mem can
mmap any area of memory that is not used by the kernel as ram.
So what I believe we will end up is that /sbin/kexec (user space)
will prepare an ELF header (data) that describes the memory regions
and details where to find the kernels register information.  The
address of that ELF header will be passed to the crash dump
capture kernel and user space combination.  The something
(probably a user space program reading /dev/mem) will look
at the ELF header and save the already prepared ELF core
dump to disk.  Possibly doing little things like merging
the MAX_NR_CPUS note segments into one so it actually conforms
to the ELF spec.
This thread started as the design discussion before finishing
that part of the implementation.   The proof of concept
implementations have happened.  We have all seen this kind
of functionality implemented.  Now is the time to come up
with a good solid design that can be maintained and merged
into the mainline kernel and distros.    
So thank you for ask questions, it means we have a better chance 
of getting a solid design and a design that those people who
care about this functionality can use.  And with a little luck
we can all wind up on agreeing on the general principles.  You came in
a little late to this conversation so a lot of details have been
settled, but if you have a good argument for doing something another
way we can certainly look at that.
