This one looks incorrect.
The code doesn't _fix_ any warnings. It just shuts them up, without fixing 
anything at all.
The fact is  "le16_to_cpu()" should act on a le16 value, and sparse 
_should_ complain if you pass it the wrong value and ask sparse to check 
with -Wbitwise.
But instead of fixing "config->wTotalLength" to be of type "le16", which 
would _fix_ the problem, you shut up the valid warning.
If you don't want to see those warnings, don't use -Wbitwise. But don't 
just shut them up.
