Arjan, I've been doing some work on traps_32.c porting over the
oops_begin()/oops_end()/_die() arrangement from traps_64.c and
then use it in unifying some more parts of fault.c.
If you have other work in this area, I'll hold off until your stuff
goes in...feel free to send me any work in progress stuff and I can
try to coordinate with you.
