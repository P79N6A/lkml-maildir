Hi
I met an issue when compiling kernel 2.6.18-rc4. I 
cross compile the kernel for a MIPS target on a PC.
MIPS architecture assigns CROSS_COMPILE in
its arch/mips/Makefile but it is not included by the 
main Makefile from the begining. So one of the
consequence is that CC variable is not correctly
set until arch's Makefile is included. It's set to "gcc"
since CROSS_COMPILE is still not defined instead
of "mips-linux-gcc". During this time CC variable is 
used to setup CFLAGS for example.
is it something known ?
thanks
Francis
