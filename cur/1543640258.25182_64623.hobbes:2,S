Ingo, this only fixes the gdt size, it doesn't fix the fact that the gdt
itself doesn't seem to be aligned at all (and to clarify, I'm talking
very much about the boot-time entry.S gdt, not the "real" run-time gdt). 
Mind doing that part too?
(I can well imagine that some CPU's may not even have the low 4 bits of
the gdt register wired up at all, since they should always be zero. So
doing a lgdt or lidt with the base not being 16-byte aligned could well
result in basically loading crap into the LDT, causing the system not to
work at all).
This is also true of "bootsect_gdt", I think. Altough I have no idea
what the bios "int 15" interfaces actually do.
