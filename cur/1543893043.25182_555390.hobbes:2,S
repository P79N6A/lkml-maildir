It was a rather poor analogy i'm afraid.  But the point i make still stands.
So far you've failed to show any reason SELinux can't be reasonably extended
to handle all the features you care about.

That would be the job of your AA extension.

So now you're claiming the real reason to let AA into the kernel is
politics? 
Just show that the feature can be easily added to SELinux and made as an
option for the end user to choose and it should go a long way to silencing
the opponents.

Remember that the SELinux API's essentially belong to everyone under the GPL.
So its not an excuse for falling into NIH syndrome and putting a bunch of
new stuff into the kernel that could instead be added as a small
extension to what already exists.
