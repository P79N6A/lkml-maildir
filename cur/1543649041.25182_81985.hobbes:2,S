O.k.  That is very good reason for making the change.

My big concern is with getting the shutdown path setup in a manner
that works, and gets testing.  When booting linux from linux with
sys_kexec a lot of my problems come back to some device driver not
getting shutdown.
Question, is there a method from the class shutdown code that we
can/should call, during reboot.  I just have this memory that for
network interfaces simply downing the interface tends to put it in
a quiescent state.  And I am wondering if that might be a general
thing we can take advantage of.  Though if the class remove methods
modify the data structures I guess that is out.
