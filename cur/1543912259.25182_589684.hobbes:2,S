We are only using 'standard' seagate SATA disks, but I would have
thought much more performance (40+ mb/sec) would be reachable.

It's more-or-less a real life problem. We have an interactive
application which, when triggered by the user, performs rendering tasks
which must operate in real-time. In attempt to secure performance, we
want to ensure everything is memory resident and that nothing might be
swapped out during the process. So, we run swapoff at that time.
If there is a decent number of pages swapped out, the user sits for a
while at a 'please wait' screen, which is not desirable. To throw some
numbers out there, likely more than a minute for 400mb of swapped pages.
Sure, we could run the whole interactive application with swap disabled,
which is pretty much what we do. However we have other non-real-time
processing tasks which are very memory hungry and do require swap. So,
there are 'corner cases' where the user can reach the real-time part of
the interactive application when there is a lot of memory swapped out.

Shutdown isn't a concern here.

According to top, those pages in swap disappear when the process is
killed. So, I don't think there are any swap-related performance issues
on the shutdown path.
Thanks.
