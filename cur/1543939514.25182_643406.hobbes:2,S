Subject: [PATCH 4/4 update] firewire: fw-core: react on bus resets while the config ROM is being fetched
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/25/412

read_rom() obtained a fresh new fw_device.generation for each read
transaction.  Hence it was able to continue reading in the middle of the
ROM even if a bus reset happened.  However the device may have modified
the ROM during the reset.  We would end up with a corrupt fetched ROM
image then.
Although all of this is quite unlikely, it is not impossible.
Therefore we now restart reading the ROM if the bus generation changed.
Note, the memory barrier in read_rom() is still necessary according to
tests by Jarod Wilson, despite of the ->generation access being moved up
in the call chain.
