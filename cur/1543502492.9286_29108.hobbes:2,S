Folks,
    I am having a problem on and off with my machine.
    It is a NEC Ready 8951 (the output of dmesg is appended).
    It seems that after prolonged periods of heavy use (8+ hours of
  interactive use) the machine will frequently lock-up.  I'm pretty sure 
  that this is a heat-related problem, but I'm not sure how to proceed
  from here to narrow it down.
    When I take the panel off of the mini-tower, none of the internals
  seem hot to the touch.  My CPU already has a fan on it that dumps the
  heat inside of the case.  The power supply also has a fan to draw the
  cooler outside air in (I keep it about 74 degrees in my house).
    I tried looking through the kernel messages that klogd puts in
  syslog, but when the machine locks up, nothing is logged.  Rebooting
  is enough to start the system working again, although heavy use will
  cause it to lock up again.
    Any thoughts?
