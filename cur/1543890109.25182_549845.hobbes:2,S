Ah, no, it's because the ioports for the rtc-cmos driver are already 
claimed by the old driver from CONFIG_RTC. The following configuration 
is valid in Kconfig:
CONFIG_RTC=y
CONFIG_RTC_CMOS=m
but will disable /proc/acpi/wakeup. It'll also be impossible to load 
CONFIG_RTC_CMOS because CONFIG_RTC has grabbed the io ports, so it's not 
possible to use the new interface. This situation doesn't appear to be 
documented, which is less than ideal...
