Hi!
With USB from 2.3.19 and my patches from www.suse.cz/development/input,
I've finally got USB joysticks to work with Linux! Could play games etc.
I've managed to get them to work on UHCI only, both the OHCI modules seem
to have problems on my OHCI card. Anyway, if you patch the kernel, configure,
load the right modules (input.o, joydev.o, usbcore.o, hid.o, usb-uhci.o),
and then calibrate the joystick (this isn't automatic yet) using jscal from
www.suse.cz/development/joystick, the normal joystick driver, you'll be
able to use your USB joystick with all joystick-aware programs.
Oh, one more thing - it crashes with MS Sidewinder Precision Pro. I wonder
what's happening there. Others seem to be OK.
Have fun,
