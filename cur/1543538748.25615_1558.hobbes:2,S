Actually I have a whole library which is ceasing to function <partially> 
due to this bug. Changing the current disc is the only problem it has
right now.  It is a definition of an object (C++) that is an interface to
a cdrom to use it as a cdplayer and the cd-changer support allows you to
change discs.  CD_Aud on freshmeat if you want to have a look.
