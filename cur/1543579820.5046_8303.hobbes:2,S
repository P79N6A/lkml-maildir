The Page Attribute Table (PAT) is an extension to the x86 page table format
that lets you enable Write Combining on a per-page basis.  Details can be found
in chapter 9.13 of the Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3
(System Programming).
I noticed that 2.4 doesn't support the Page Attribute Table, despite the fact
that it has a X86_FEATURE_PAT macro in processor.h.  Are there any plans to add
this support?  Ideally, I'd like it to be as a parameter for ioremap.
