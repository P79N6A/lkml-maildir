You are having IO problems doing bzip2 ???
This sounds as if your application is doing something silly like e.g. 
using O_DIRECT or you are mounting your filesystems with "-o sync".
On my 1.8 GHz Athlon, it takes 2.5 minutes to compress a 250 MB kernel 
tar to 40 MB - and this is with the data cached in RAM, so no IO 
involved. That's 1.7 MB/s resp. 0.3 MB/s.
I'm even having problems to imagine IO problems with 4 or 8 CPU 
machines doing parallel bzip2 to a single disk - with any filesystem.

bzip2 already checksums all data, so why do you need a second checksum 
at the filesystem level for your backups?

I don't need Google for this.
It's easy to extract from git that patches that were applied to the 
Linux kernel during the last 2 years contained 3196 unique 
Signed-off-by: lines.
Some people might have lines with different email addresses, but this 
still makes > 2000 contributors during the last 2 years alone. Plus all 
the other people who contributed during the first 14 years of Linux 
kernel development but didn't during the last 2 years.
You could argue whether there were really 10.000 people or "only"
5.000 people who contributed code to the Linux kernel, but 
that doesn't make a real difference.
