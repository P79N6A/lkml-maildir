Hi all...
I have built 2.6.10-rc2-mm1, and as nVidia drivers do not work with it,
i configured xorg-6.8.1 to use the standard 'nv' driver.
But now X redraws are dog slow, you can count pixels redrawing on the
screen if you move a window in filled mode.
Somebodyt has a clue about why can this be happening ?
From deep in my memory I remember this was related to mtrr settings.
With the nVidia driver I have:
werewolf:~> cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x3ff00000 (1023MB), size=   1MB: uncachable, count=1
reg02: base=0xe0000000 (3584MB), size= 128MB: write-combining, count=1
reg03: base=0xe8000000 (3712MB), size= 128MB: write-combining, count=1
and with the nv standard driver:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x3ff00000 (1023MB), size=   1MB: uncachable, count=1
reg02: base=0xe8000000 (3712MB), size= 128MB: write-combining, count=1
One is missing. It is an i875P chipset.
Any idea ?
Ah, this also happens on one other box, also with an nvidia card, but this
box never had the binary drivers installed, it is just a server.
This one is a Via Apollo Pro266, and its mtrr:
nada:~# cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0xf0000000 (3840MB), size=  64MB: write-combining, count=1
reg02: base=0xe8000000 (3712MB), size=  64MB: write-combining, count=1
TIA
