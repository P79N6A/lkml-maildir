Hi,
The problems I had seen with my script are followings:
1. disk inode is filled by 0.
2. disk inode is written by deleted inode.
3. a directory is gone during and after the test.
4. a directory is gone during the test, but it actually
exists after the test. (test script says "no such file or dir",
but when I see the directory, it is there.)
5. file data is destroyed.
Problem #1 to #3 happened both on ext2 and ext3.
#5 only on ext2 and #4 only on ext3.
Thanks,
Yoshi
