Without even fixing it, the difference in kernel code size is still 20K 
less than what using a register does.  The benefit of using a register is
that accessing a field in current can simply offset the register, compared 
to the pda usage that requires loading current into a register before the 
offset is performed.  Using 'size' on the resulting kernels shows:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
4132289  819632  317256 5269177  5066b9 vmlinux.orig
4119951  819632  317256 5256839  503687 vmlinux.non-volatile
4097300  819560  317256 5234116  4fddc4 vmlinux.r10
I think that using a register makes more sense given the benefits.
