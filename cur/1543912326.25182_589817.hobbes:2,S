Well, rounding to PAGE_SIZE exposes PAGE_SIZE as well, just in a
non-intuitive fashion. :)
If we're going to modify what the user specifies, we should probably at
least mandate that writes are only a "suggestion" and users must read
back the value to ensure what actually got committed.
If we're going to round in any direction, shouldn't we round up?  If a
user specifies 4097 bytes and uses two pages, we don't want to complain
when they hit that second page.
