The docs are available:

If you have some comment or idea to improve it, please, post it to 
the relevant mailing list.

Then it is your problem. I've not seen a single problematic technical 
information from your mails.

You're a bit mixing things:
a) we're not trying to be more compatible than OSS code in kernel, if you 
   like to do the mixing in kernel, simply write a new ALSA lowlevel 
   driver which will do it; I'm sure when the quality of your code will be 
   good,  we'll include it to the ALSA tree, but we are not going this
   way unless someone else will maintain this code
b) you're requestion to avoid scheduler participation in the audio 
   processing and yes, we have this solution already (dmix), but not in 
   kernel
c) as you said, the kernel should contain only critical code to drive
   hardware, sample rate conversion, sample format conversions and so on
   are NOT part of this code in my opinion

Which limitations? We can do all things like OSS API. The whole point of 
all problems is that OSS has the API entry point in syscalls which is 
quite bad so the redirection is problematic.
