Hi Sam,
Looks good to me and should satisfy our habits^w usages models.
The one minor question is the environment variable name (K64BIT or
something else, like Guillaume brought up).  Personally I don't
care how it's spelled.  IOW, K64BIT is sufficient, but if there is a
goal to be able to place any CONFIG_symbol on the command line or
as an env. variable, they might as well all be named with CONFIG_*.
Thanks,
