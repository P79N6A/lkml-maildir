You're absolutely right, I do have 2GB support compiled. However, my
problems
with kswapd began when my kernel had 1GB support. I tried 2GB hoping it
might
help - it didn't.
My hardware:
Motherboard: Assus P2B
CPU: PIII-450
256MB RAM
13MB HDD (EIDE - primary master)
EIDE-ATAPI CDROM (primary slave)
ATAPI CDRW (secondary master)
FDD
2 network cards
    eepro100 (eth0)
    3c590 (eth1)
sound card (ensoniq es1370)
As far as I can tell, the hardware is O.K. I first noticed the problem
after
upgrading from RedHat6.0 (kernel 2.2.5) to RedHat6.1 (kernel 2.2.12) It
didn't matter if I used RedHat's stock kernel or if I compiled my own. I
then
upgraded the kernel to 2.2.13, bu that didn't help either.
