Correct.  Moreover, most of the struct file instances that have ->private_data
tend to set it during ->open() and never change it afterwards.

The thing being, if you are already contended you are playing "I'll release
CPU now" vs. "I'll spin in hope that contender will go away right now".
IOW, it's a win only if you get contention often and for short intervals.
Which is a very good indication that something is rotten with your locking
scheme.  Like, say it, having lost the control over the amount of locks
as the result of brainde^Woverenthusiastic belief that fine-grained ==
good.  With everything that follows from that...
