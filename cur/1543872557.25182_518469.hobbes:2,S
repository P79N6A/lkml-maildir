Grumble!
This /really/ should have gone through me and linux-ide first.
Alan has been actively working on PATA ACPI, and we have been debugging 
ACPI issues as well.  PLEASE coordinate with the maintainer, when 
touching code outside of drivers/acpi!
AFAICS this patch went in with zero appearance on LKML or another 
related list, until submission.  This is /not/ how we do Linux development.
