No it's not a step backwards. It's a step forward. Its just bloat to have
a bunch of font sets built into the kernel when you can use a userland app
to change the fonts. IMO you should only be able to compile in one font
set and use a userland app to change the font sets otherwise. Userland
apps are your friend :)
