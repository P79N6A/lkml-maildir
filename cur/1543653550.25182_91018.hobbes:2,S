Yes.  But the workaround of calling the module "unknown" isn't nice
either: just put "no_module_init;" in and be done with it (it's also a
big hint that the module doesn't do anything itself).
Richard Henderson, Kai and myself are discussing a post-link stage for
modules, which will allow us to add the .modname section at that time,
but 99% of the cases are already fixed.
Sorry for any trouble,
Rusty.
