...You mean any comments?...
Well, I've written something similar about something similar somewhere
else, which you could remember, but here I'm even more "brutal", sorry!
So, I think this text is wrong - at least in this place. I probably can
repeat some of Adrian's comments, but IMHO the main thing is that this
shouldn't deter any user, who got this, maybe momentary idea to report
something. So, it definitely shouldn't be longer than maybe 5 sentences,
with any "you should" if possible.
So, maybe it could start just like Adrian proposed:
>> Go to 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/
 and click on "Enter a new bug report".
plus e.g.:
"Alternatively you can write an e-mail to linux-kerel@vger.kernel.org
 with '[BUG]' at the beginning of a subject (no need to subscribe).
 If you feel like doing this with more details, read this document,
 please: ..."
Regards,
Jarek P.
PS: Btw., did you notice how even main developers respect current
(previous?) version of this doc while reporting bugs here?
