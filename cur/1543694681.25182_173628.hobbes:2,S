   This is different matter.
   This is IO bound task - and I'm not sure how -Os will perform there.
   But still this depends on routing protocols and their requirements.
   In any way in this case bottleneck is PCI bus (DMA over PCI from NIC 
to main memory and back). I bet software will show up in timing tests as 
taking <10% of whole time.
