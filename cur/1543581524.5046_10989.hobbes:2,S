Hi,
From socket(7):
       SO_LINGER
...
              When  enabled,  a  close(2) or shutdown(2) will not
              return until all queued  messages  for  the  socket
              have  been  successfully sent or the linger timeout
              has been reached.
I'm not seeing shutdown(2) block on a TCP socket. This is Linux kernel
2.2.16 (RH7.0). Is this a kernel bug, a documentation bug, or does it all
work fine and it's a Chris bug?
Cheers
Chris
