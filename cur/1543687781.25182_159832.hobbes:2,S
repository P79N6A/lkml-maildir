Could you elaborate some more?  I agree that the MAP_PRIVATE mapping may
not see cpu1's write because of cache incoherencies (but that's what I
believe is covered by the `unspecified' bit of the MAP_PRIVATE
definition above).  MAP_PRIVATE is COW (i.e. the page is marked read
only while it's shared), so there can be no data to flush in the cache
for the page of the MAP_PRIVATE process...The only scenario I see where
we can get cache based data destruction is if two cache aliases both
contain dirty caches for the page (which can only happen for MAP_SHARED
RW, which we already have the correct semantics for...they're racing to
do a msync and the last one in wins).
