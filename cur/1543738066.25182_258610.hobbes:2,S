This is the same as version <= 0xf || version >= 0x14; I'm rather
suspicious, as the docs have long since been purged, making this
hopeless for anyone without archives (or a good memory) dating back to
that time to check. All that's really needed is citing the version that
comes out of the version register and checking other APIC
implementations to verify they don't have versions tripping this check,
the latter of which is feasible for those relying on still-extant
documentation. Better yet would be dredging up the docs... So, what is
the range of the version numbers reported by i82489DX's?
