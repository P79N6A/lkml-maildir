Apparently you haven't played with Debian recently:
  $ ls -ld /usr/include/{linux,asm}{,/errno.h}
  drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root         4096 Nov  3 05:34 /usr/include/asm
  -rw-r--r--   1 root     root         6162 Apr 14  1997 /usr/include/asm/errno.h
  drwxr-xr-x   6 root     root        20480 Nov  3 05:34 /usr/include/linux
  -rw-r--r--   1 root     root          305 Jun 12  1997 /usr/include/linux/errno.h
  $ 
The symlinks used to be the right way to do it.  But I believe some
time ago the glibc maintainers decided to copy the kernel headers
rather than continue to symlink them.  There are good points and bad
points about doing this (I'm not sure I agree with Linus and the glibc
people), but the decision has been made.
I don't know if the other glibc-based distributions put the symlinks
back in.  It's possible.  I still say that if your /usr/include/linux
is a dangling symlink, it is a bug in your headers, not a bug in the
kernel.  Obviously many solutions are possible: a correct symlink
/usr/include/linux, a correct symlink /usr/src/linux, a real directory
/usr/include/linux, a real directory /usr/src/linux/include (possibly
without the rest of the source tree)....
