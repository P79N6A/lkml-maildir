Hi there
I am not quite sure who to send this to.......
With much help from Nicolas Mailhot and Flavio Stanchina, I have tested a 
Kernel 2.4.20 patch for AGP support for the VIA KM266 / KL266. It 
patches cleanly, compiles and runs in full 3D H/W acceleration with my 
ATI Radeon 9000.
Who do I send this to so that it can be included in the kernel?
Regards,
D.Radel.
