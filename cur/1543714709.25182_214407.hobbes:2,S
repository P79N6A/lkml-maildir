Hmm, no it didn't.  The "illegal capability" is the hardware acting
broken (what kind of EHCI hardware?); I've had reports of similar
stuff happening after ACPI resume (bogus PCI config space values,
in this case zero).
The "-19" means -ENODEV, which seem likely to be another case of a PCI
request not responding correctly:  handshake() failing because reading
a register returned 0xffffffff.
Looks like a cleanup path needs to handle early failure a bit better;
likely just having ehci_stop test for ehci->async non-null (before
calling scan-async to clean up any pending work) would suffice.
