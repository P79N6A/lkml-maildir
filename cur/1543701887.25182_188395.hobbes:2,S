Yup.
I'd actually personally prefer a stronger test than the one in 2.4.24, and 
my personal preference would be for just disallowing the degenerate cases
entirely.  I don't see a "mremap away" as being a valid thing to do, since 
if that is what you want, why not just do a "munmap()"?
Uli cc'd, to check whether libc could ever use a zero-sized mremap()..
