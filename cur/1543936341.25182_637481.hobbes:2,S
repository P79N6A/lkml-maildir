These patches are a preresuisite to
gregkh-driver-pm-acquire-device-locks-prior-to-suspending.patch and its
later fixed-up versions.
So what I have now is
revert-gregkh-driver-pm-acquire-device-locks-prior-to-suspending.patch
pm-introduce-destroy_suspended_device.patch
pm-do-not-destroy-create-devices-while-suspended-in-msrc-rev-2.patch
pm-do-not-destroy-create-devices-while-suspended-in-mce_64c.patch
pm-do-not-destroy-create-devices-while-suspended-in-cpuidc.patch
pm-acquire-device-locks-on-suspend-rev-3.patch
pm-acquire-device-locks-on-suspend-rev-3-checkpatch-fixes.patch
pm-acquire-device-locks-on-suspend-rev-3-checkpatch-fixes-2.patch
So what needs to happen in Greg's tree is
a) drop the old gregkh-driver-pm-acquire-device-locks-prior-to-suspending.patch
b) apply these four patches
c) apply the new pm-acquire-device-locks-on-suspend-rev-3.patch (and its fixups)
