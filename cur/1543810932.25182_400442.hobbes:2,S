Certainly the PAE kernel might as well do that and the AMD64 if it
doesn't already. There are complications however getting above 16MB
because 16bit protected mode (and maybe the BIOS helpers - I need to
check that) can't hit it.
We also used to have people DMAing into static kernel buffers in older
days but hopefully that habit is now dead and gone because modules
sorted most of it out.
