Wow!  
As we just ordered a few more P5A boards (due to arrive by
the end of the week), and we still have those MPE3136AT 
drives, we can run some more tests in the next 2 or 3 weeks 
or so.
With the new P5A boards we don't have the exact same 
conditions as with the machines where the problems occured,
but I think it's at least worth a try.
I'll send you a short notice when our testing equipment
is up and running. Is there any special test procedure
we can try (other than just stress-test the IDE subsystem)?
I can also send you the exact part-, serial- and revision-
number of the hard drives. For the P5A boards we only have
the serial-numbers documented, if that's of interest (for
more information we would have to dis-assemble our customers
machines, and I really would like to avoid that!), but I
can also send you the output of "lspci -vv"
