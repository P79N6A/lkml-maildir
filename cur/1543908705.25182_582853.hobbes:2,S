Now i think it is a userspace problem, more exactly something in KDE.
I got a new laptop(a Dell D830) and
discovered that suspend works with gnome and when i directly run /etc/acpi/sleep.sh.
(with KDE running, from a xterm... but so somehow it can't interact with
the KDE userspace stuff) (i have no remote idea what KDE is doing)
So i tried sleep.sh also on my old laptop (D810) once again and it works
reliable, well at least for 13 times.
Directly afterwards i tried the suspend to ram button again and it
failed again as stated above.
Can someone else with suspend problems and KDE verify this?
i filled a bug against KDE in ubuntu:
