	I forgot to add through agpgart.

	That is correct, but I do not think that they knew about my backport, it is 
not official, and it is still untested well and only few days old. From my 
previos experience with nVidia and ATI drivers I can tell you that they have 
bulit in AGP support, and they do not need agpgart to run. They will use it 
for sure for 2x and 4x but it is questionable, that they do any checking if 
agpgart can do 8x. 
	I've never programmed graphics but I intend, as soon as I find some extra 
time, to try to write a small program which will check if all AGP modes work 
correctly with my backport.
