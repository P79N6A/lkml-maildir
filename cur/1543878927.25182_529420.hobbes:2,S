I applied this, but I still think there's some more work to do in this
area:
 > The port sharing feature mixed kernel virtual addresses as well as

there's no guarantee that a physical address fits in 40 or 44 or 63
bits on a 64 bit platform.  So you've fixed this problem on the
platforms you test for now, but it could easily crop up again...
