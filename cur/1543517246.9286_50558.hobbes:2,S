i just remembered that something in the 'asynchron userland' area needed
to be careful about the direction flag. The patch does not (want to)  
change user-space semantics, so this was just a side-comment. Obviously
the state of normal signal handlers are guaranteed by the kernel, but
user-space things like soft-threading and other asynchron mechanizms (like
longjmp) are not necesserily immune to a stale 'std'.

in the kernel the situation is simple: if we protect all doors and windows
going in an out of the kernel then nothing ever can get the direction flag
wrong.
