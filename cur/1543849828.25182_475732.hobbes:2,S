Hello,
Have got the same problem. I just add the following:
1) dmesg claims __create_workqueue and __destroy_workqueue are undefined 
(kernel syms)
2) I've checked out System.map and they're of course present
3) no problem under 2.6.18.1
4) from ndiswrapper-1.15 to ndiswrapper-1.26
By the way, i would like so much if someone explain me why, since 
2.6.18, on my Acer Laptop i had to add irqpoll to correctly boot (had 
already to use acpi=noirq) and still have strange errors on DVD 
detection at boot which strangely has not any consequence later.
The problem is there since 2.6.18.
Thanks,
Gianluca
