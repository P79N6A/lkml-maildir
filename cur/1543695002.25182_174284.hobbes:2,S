I need the following patch w/ test8-mm1 to get it compile. Otherwise it 
works quite well (i810fb). The screen is a bit distorted for the first 
few messages after elpp kicks in and the bottom line, where the messages 
appear, isn't cleared to the end. Also the background right of the eye 
is changing from black to red in the middle of the boot progress for no 
apparent reason (I've no supporting bootscripts).
Thanks,
Jan
