While booting my system I got the following error while my
IDE drive was being fsck'd:
Sep 22 17:48:52 test kernel: scsi0: PCI error Interrupt at seqaddr = 0x8
Sep 22 17:48:52 test kernel: scsi0: Data Parity Error Detected during address or write data phase
None of my SCSI drives had been mounted.
I'm running 2.4.19ac4. My hardware: Adaptec 29160 with 3 Maxtor Atlas III drives
(2 internal and one external). 
The error did not repeat, and I seem to be able to access my SCSI drives with no problem.
Is this error anything to worry about?
