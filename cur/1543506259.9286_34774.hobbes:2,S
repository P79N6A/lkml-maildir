Subject: NCR/SYM large patch for 2.3.13
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I plan to propose a large ncr/sym driver update for linux-2.3/2.4.
A pre-patch of this stuff is available at 
ftp://ftp.tux.org/.
The URL is (modulo mispellings):
ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/roudier/drivers/linux/experimental/patch-53c8xx-1.5e-pre1-2.3.13.gz
This patch also fixes the problems due to the changes in the pci_dev
structure (base_address[6] changed to resource[6]).
If you are using Ncr/Symbios 53c8xx controllers, you may want to give this
patch a try and report problems if any. Thanks.
(All arch. are concerned)
I will prepare a patch against linux-2.3.14 when this one will be out of 
the door.
Gérard.
PS: This patch does not apply cleanly to 2.3.14-pre kernels.
