Hi, all
    I update to 2.6.12,all finished but "make install",
it is:
sh /root/test/linux-2.6.12/arch/i386/boot/install.sh 2.6.12
arch/i386/boot/bzImage System.map "/boot"
grubby fatal error: unable to find a suitable template
I asked google,and do my best to fix it ,but no answer,I think it must
be a normal question.
I wishes fix it,not  boot my latest kernel by hand. 
Thanks.
