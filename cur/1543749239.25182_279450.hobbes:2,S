The international notation for transconductance is Siemens, no longer
MHO (Ohm spelled backwards). This happened at the same time that c.p.s. 
was changed to Hz. But, because the Siemens company is one of the
world's largest, the "S" didn't catch on as readily as Hz and others.
Siemens is so common you need to look up MHO in some really complete
dictionary to find its usage as MHO.

The older MHO was usually stated in micro-mho for vacuum
tubes. For instance low mu triodes like 12AT7 had a mu
of 10 (10 micro-mho). The "gainier" cousin, the 12AX7
had a mu of 100 (100 micro-mho).
Some modern FETs have transconductance up to 10
MHO (10 Siemens).
