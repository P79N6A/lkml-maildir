Yes. Type "make defconfig" in the kernel source top directory, on an x86 
box.

i've excluded the VIAPRO driver on that box (and only the VIAPRO driver - 
i.e. all those other I2C drivers still run frequently) - and the problem 
has not reoccured in about ~1000 bootups.
Combined with the fact that this box has a VIA chipset, does that not 
implicate the viapro driver, at least to a certain degree?
