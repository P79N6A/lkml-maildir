Hi,
Sorry, no patch, just a bugreport. :)
I did a mistake in some Kconfig changes (locally) and got a segfault
from conf:
#0  0x10005fe0 in sym_check_deps ()
#1  0x10005f40 in sym_check_expr_deps ()
#2  0x1000605c in sym_check_deps ()
#3  0x1000f3f4 in conf_parse ()
#4  0x10003824 in main ()
The way to reproduce is simple. I just added the equivalent of this
to arch/powerpc/Kconfig:
---
config TEST1
        bool
        depends on TEST2 && PCI
        select TEST2
config TEST2
        bool
---
Neither TEST1 nor TEST2 exists in the existing .config when I run make
oldconfig to reproduce.
It's clearly invalid in that it depends on what it selects, but it should
just abort instead.
