Firstly, many thanks for pointing out a patch for tcpdump 3.4.

Whatever, here's the code:
... rii_p = 0;
...
if(trh->saddr[0] & TR_RII)
{
  trh->saddr[0]&=0x7f;
  if (((ntohs(trh->rcf) & TR_RCF_LEN_MASK) >> 8) > 2)
  {
    rii_p = 1;
  }
}
So the byte may be clobbered at the same time as rii_p is zero. If this
is an error case then it might be better to printk and abort early. If
not, the byte should be unclobbered before exit.
Also, there are two exit points to the function, one on a alloc failure
and the other off the end. If the alloc fails the byte is not unclobbered.
OK, I admit this is picky!
Giuliano.
