Looks like you are not a native English speaker. "We" is incorrect here, as you 
only speak for yourself.

Looks like you are badly informed, so I encourage you to get yourself informed 
properly before sending your next postig....
libscg includes 22 different SCSI low level transport implementations.
-	Only 5 of them allow a /dev/hd* device name related access.
-	11 of them use file descriptors as handles for sending SCSI 
	commands but do not have a name <-> fs relation and thus
	_need_ a SCSI device naming scheme as libscg offers.
	This is because there is no 1:1 relation between SCSI addressing
	and a fd retrieved from a /dev/* entry.
-	6 of them not even allow to get a file descriptors as handles for 
	sending SCSI commands. These platforms of course need the SCSI device 
	naming scheme as libscg offers.
Conclusion:
17 Platforms _need_ the addressing scheme libscg offers
5  Platforms _may_ use a different access method too.
NOTE: Amongst the 6 plaforms that do not allow to even get a file descriptor 
there is a modern OS like MacOS X
BTW: the wording of your posting did give you a negative score.
If you continue the same way, it may be that your next posting will 
remain unanswered even though it may be wring and needs a correction like this 
one.
