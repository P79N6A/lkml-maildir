Len,
Thanks for the suggestion but I do not have any option of turning any modes 
on in the BIOS.
At this point I am thinking/hoping that  this is quirk introduced by mobo 
that is triggering this behavior in the driver that can be fixed by somebody 
easily. Although I do not have the skill set to device a solution.
