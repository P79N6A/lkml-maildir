Okay, but can we clearly delineate responsibilities? I'm happy to deal
with the suspend-to-disk stuff because I understand it. I don't however
understand suspend-to-ram or kobjects (yes, I will need to learn them)
or device drivers, so I don't want anyone thinking I'm going to
concentrate on anything more than what I'm already doing. That said, I'd
love to take over software suspend and work on merging the work I've
done.
