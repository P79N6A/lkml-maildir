lguest was supposed to be a demonstration of paravirt_ops, so it
shouldn't have added any.  But note that I did change some other things,
such as the esp0 initialization for the swapper.
Puppies are still alive and well.  Although Andi not pushing into 2.6.21
(yet?) made puppies sad 8(

Yes, Xen really like their direct pagetable stuff.  I'm a
traditionalist, myself, but it did require some expansion of
paravirt_ops.
KVM might well want more, although from here it's more likely we'll move
some of the hooks up the stack a little IMHO.
