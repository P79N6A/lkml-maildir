Something wrong with the in-kernel pcnet_cs?

Well, it's in the help for the CRC32 option that it's available to enable 
external-kernel tree drivers to access these functions.  If you are 
running make oldconfig you'll hit the question and if you don't know what 
it's about you should consult help...
Seems reasonable to me.  Same aplies to deflate, etc. support routines.
