If you want to do binary only then it depends solely how your lawyers intend
to interpret the concept of 'linking'. Linus comments on the matter have no
impact since the kernel isnt all his copyright and he has linked in code by
bodies who are most definitely opposed to binary modules.
The same applies for source code under 'additional restrictions' as the GPL
calls things disallowing stuff it allows.
If you are releasing modules with source under terms that are at least as free
as the GPL (eg BSD without advertising clause) then nobody has any cares. We
probably wouldnt merge it with the mainstream kernel due to the lack of
patent trap protection in the BSD license but I suspect you dont want that
anyway.
