Okay. That's good. The guy that asked to get the image to find out what
was happening can probably use a small piece of that to find out what
is going on. It probably is a CD data + Music image where the first
readable stuff is data, followed by a music image.
You can try cdda2wav -D0,4,0, -B. You will probably get some *.wav files.

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
