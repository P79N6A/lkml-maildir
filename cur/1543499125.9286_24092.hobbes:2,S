I agree that far. I'm not entirely sure if the number of channels/
stripes/slices/whatever should have to be discovered iteratively (e.g.
increment index until FIONDEV_COPIES is no longer set), or if we
should have a field for the total number.

As I've said before, I'm sceptical about assuming that we have either
straight mirroring over M drives or XOR over N drives. E.g. you could
have a mixture of both, or you could even use a system where you can
recover from the loss of more than a single drive.
So a single bit (FIONDEV_XOR) is unlikely to be sufficient. But we
could probably get away with an algorithm index, although it may
become ugly for more complex cases:
  0  reserved; description of redundancy structure is unavailable
  1  mirroring; all available indices refer to a direct copy
  2  XOR; the last available channel contains an XOR of the others
Then FIONDEV_COPIES implies that additional information is available
in the algorithm index field. Maybe its name should then be changed to
FIONDEV_STRUCTURED or such. The algorithm field stays constant for all
accesses to the same location. Also, only mapping the last location
will advance the current file position.
Gets a bit complex :-(

Well, technically it could, because it happens to know where the data
goes. However, this would involve allocating space in the RAID, via
the file system, and then filling it via direct writes to the underlying
devices. Pretty horrible, if you ask me.
No, as far as LILO is concerned, I consider this a case of policy at a
higher level. LILO just writes a single boot loader in a well-defined,
clean way. If there's replication in the RAID, you install multiple
boot loaders, and you tell LILO explicitly where they go.
