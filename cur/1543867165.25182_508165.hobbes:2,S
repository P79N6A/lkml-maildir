So, should I understand from this that automatic tuning and the AKT 
framework itself would make sense, given that I find the rigth tunables 
it should be applied to?
Actually, dont' know if you had the opportunity to read all the patches, 
but there are 2 other tunables AKT is proposed to be applied to:
. max_threads, the tunable limit on nr_threads
. max_files, the tunable limit on nr_files
