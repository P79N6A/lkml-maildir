:-) If it's anybody's fault, it's mine for not testing properly. My bad.
In the case of defio, I think it's no trouble to build a list of vmas
at mmap time and then to iterate through them when it's ready for
mkclean time as you suggested. I don't fully understand page->index
yet. I had thought it was only used by swap cache or file map.
On an unrelated note, I was looking for somewhere to stuff a 16 bit
offset (so that I have a cheap way to know which struct page
corresponds to which framebuffer block or offset) for another driver.
I had thought page->index was it but I think I am wrong now.
Thanks,
