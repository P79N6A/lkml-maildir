it will work. However I am not sure that is the best design. We need to
make one round-trip into an extra driver. We might gonna need these kind
of driver that hook in-between and does nasty things anyway, because of
broken HID devices.
The cleanest solution without a layer violation is that you can register
a driver for a specific VID/PID and then report id (one or more). All
reports with ids that we don't have a special driver for are handled by
the default HID->input driver or handed over to hidraw if not parseable.
The reports for ids with a special driver are handed over to the driver.
And for hidraw it would be nice if we can apply filters for specific
report ids to keep the round-trips and overhead at a minimum.
Regards
Marcel
