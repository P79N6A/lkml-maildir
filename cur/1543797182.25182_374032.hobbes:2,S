Subject: [PATCH] vm: enhance __alloc_pages to prioritize pagecache eviction when pressed for memory
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hey all-
     I was recently shown this issue, wherein, if the kernel was kept full of
pagecache via applications that were constantly writing large amounts of data to
disk, the box could find itself in a position where the vm, in __alloc_pages
would invoke the oom killer repetatively within try_to_free_pages, until such
time as the box had no candidate processes left to kill, at which point it would
panic.  While this seems like the right thing to do in general, it occured to me
that if we could simply force some additional evictions from pagecache before we
tried to reclaim memory in try_to_free_pages, we stood a good chance of avoiding
the need to invoke the oom killer at all (assuming that the pages freed from
pagecache were physically contiguous).  The following patch preforms this
operation and in my testing, and that of the origional reporter, results in
avoidance of the oom killer being invoked for the workloads which would
previously oom kill the box to the point that it would panic.
Thanks & Regards
Neil
