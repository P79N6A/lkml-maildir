"stop when DIR_Name[0] == 0" should be added after cleanup. The option
is not needed.
Honestly, I wouldn't like to add the "add a new DIR_Name[0] = 0" part.
The option is added easy, but it is not removed easy. And we must
maintain it.  (BTW, looks like that patch is buggy)
Those stuff makes a change of the normal path difficult really. At the
same reason, I removed the fat_cvf stuff.
Thanks.
