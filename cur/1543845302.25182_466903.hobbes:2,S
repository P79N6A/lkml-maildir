The post-crash kernel is not realy dependant on the pre-crash kernel.
What is important is that either the kernel is relocatable
(which is being worked on for x86 and i386), or it is compiled to
run at a non-default address and that address corresponds
to the region reserved by the crashkernel command line parameter
passed to the pre-crash kernel.
The post-crash kernel will also need CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP 
and likely CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE

Yes

There is a lower bound to how small you can make the space, which
is basically how little memory space your post-crash kernel needs.
16M is probably pushing it, but 32M should be more than possible.
Experimentation is really the order of the day here.
