pthreads (whitch is now NPTL), is part of glibc and can be found at
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/
You can find nice manual here, and overview
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html
Also keep in mind that soem distros, patch their glibs, so you might want
to get sources from there
have a nice day,
