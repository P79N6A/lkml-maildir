The patch below isn't compile tested or correct for those cases where
alloc_remap is called or where arch code has allocated node_mem_map for
CONFIG_FLAT_NODE_MEM_MAP. It's just conveying what I believe the issue is.
Andy added code to buddy allocator which doesn't require the zone's endpoints
to be aligned to MAX_ORDER. I think the issue is that the buddy
allocator requires the node_mem_map's endpoints to be MAX_ORDER aligned. 
Otherwise __page_find_buddy could compute a buddy not in node_mem_map
for partial MAX_ORDER regions at zone's endpoints. page_is_buddy will
detect that these pages at endpoints aren't PG_buddy (they were zeroed
out by bootmem allocator and not part of zone).  Of course the negative
here is we could waste a little memory but the positive is eliminating
all the old checks for zone boundary conditions.
SPARSEMEM won't encounter this issue because of MAX_ORDER size
constraint when SPARSEMEM is configured. ia64 VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP doesn't
need the logic either because the holes and endpoints are handled
differently.  This leaves checking alloc_remap and other arches which
privately allocate for node_mem_map.
Any how I could be totally wrong but like I said this requires more
thought.
