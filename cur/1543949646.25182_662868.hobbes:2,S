Yes, I know that. That's why I am asking why this matters. If there's 
some sort of regression because SLUB does HWCACHE_ALIGN bit differently, 
we need to fix that. Not that it necessarily means we have to change 
HWCACHE_ALIGN but I am assuming Nick has some reason why he wants to 
introduce the SMP alignment flag.
