Moore's law is definitely working against us here.  Register counts, 
pipeline depths, core counts, and clock multipliers are all increasing 
in the long run.  At some point in the future, barrier() will be 
universally regarded as a hammer too big for most purposes.  Whether or 
not removing it now constitutes premature optimization is arguable, but 
I think we should allow such optimization to happen (or not happen) in 
architecture-dependent code, and provide a consistent API that doesn't 
require the use of such things in arch-independent code where it might 
turn into a totally superfluous performance killer depending on what 
hardware it gets compiled for.
