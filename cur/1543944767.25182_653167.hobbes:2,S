You missed it, then:
http://linuxtv.org/pipermail/v4l-dvb-maintainer/2008-February/006293.html
was sent in 25 minutes after the message Mauro mentioned.

Read the code that was actually committed: here's a helpful link:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mchehab/v4l-dvb.git;a=commitdiff;h=41a93616082af630e7242cba766a161d7847560b

You properly raised a red flag, and got a fix in return.
Don't expect fixes to be accompanied by a "are you happy now?"
follow-up; if you took the time to check the first commit, take the time
to read the rest.
Now... it looks as if you simply missed the second patch; it happens.
But next time you feel like sending this kind of message(s) to 3
separate lists, at least check your mail history (or read the code
you're commenting).
