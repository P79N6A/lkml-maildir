Thank for all the information!
Looking at the data I found out that the "_up_up_up" is in fact the
token with code "0", which means that the token "0" was being used a
lot more than the others.
This pointed me in the direction of the bug.
My error was to assume the .word assembler directive meant a 16-bit
unsigned integer, when in fact it depends on the architecture and is
32 bits on sparc :(
This one liner should solve the problem.
Please verify that in fact it does solve it, and I'll send a proper
"[PATCH]" message to be included in the next version.
