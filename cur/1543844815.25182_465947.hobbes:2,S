the main goals for 2.6.16 are:
- no regressions
- security fixes
And I did always say that things like adding new PCI IDs are considered 
OK for 2.6.16.

No, all it says is:
- there was no reason for releasing 2.6.16.30 very soon
- my TODO list still contains reviewing 65 of the patches the -stable
  team added to 2.6.17

Except for 2 bug fixes, all of them were patches the -stable team added 
to 2.6.17.

No, see [1]:

Q:
What is the target audience for this 2.6.16 series?
A:
The target audience are users still using 2.4 (or who'd still use kernel 
2.4 if they weren't forced to upgrade to 2.6 for some reason) who want a 
stable kernel series including security fixes but excluding many 
regressions.
It might also be interesting for distributions that prefer stability 
over always using the latest stuff.
<--  snip  -->
The 2.6.16 series is an offer.
If you don't want to use it it's OK.
Distributions can use it, cherry pick from it, or ignore it.
Whether a distribution uses 2.6.16 or a more recent kernel (that will 
anyway support more hardware than 2.6.16 ever will), and if a 
distribution that uses 2.6.16 will ever follow the 2.6.16 series depends 
on the goals of the distribution.
