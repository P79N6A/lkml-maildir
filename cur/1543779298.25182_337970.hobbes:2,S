This is a warning, not an error, but it's one of two symptoms of
BIOS level problems on your board.
	- Try booting with the "usb-handoff" kernel parameter,
	  to kick in more specialized PCI quirk handling.
	- See if there's a BIOS setting related to USB that you
	  can change.  Sometimes they use quirky modes.
	- See if there's a BIOS update for your motherboard.
I think that "continuing" codepath came from someone at Phoenix, FWIW;
the problem is that I see the PCI quirks code has evolved even farther
from the main copy of the init code in the USB tree.  Sigh.

That is, you think it should always see the adapter,
not just when it's not plugged in at boot time?
Sure sounds like BIOS problems to me.
