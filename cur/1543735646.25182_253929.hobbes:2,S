Subject: Machine crashes after disk failure and use of software raid options with 2.4.18 kernel

One of my machines just crashed while it should not do that at disk failure. 
Can someone hint me if the data is still intact before I start with the 
recover?
The disks (4) are configured in raid5 configuration using software raid only. 
Disk setup:
Per disk: 1 GB system, 1 GB swap, 70GB raid space
Only one system disk (I think that is exactly the disk which gave up, so the 
machine won't boot), installed on it: Suse 8.2 professional, standard kernel 
without changes to it.
I don't have any further information than this :-(
