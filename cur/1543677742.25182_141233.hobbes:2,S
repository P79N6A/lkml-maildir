The reason for this is because the framebuffers most often depend on the 
bus being set up. Usually this happening later in the boot process. What 
are trying to do? Retrieve the earlier printk messages. Do you have 
DUMMY_CONSOLE set to Y. I believe the data is transfered from dummycon to 
fbcon after fbcon is initialized. If you having problems with that try 
increasing the size of dummycon's "screen". See dummycon.c for more 
details.
