IMO, agreed.
Max KB per request really should be set by the driver, as it's a 
hardware-specific thing that (as we see :)) is often errata-dependent.
Tangent:  My non-pessimistic fix will involve submitting a single sector 
DMA r/w taskfile manually, then proceeding with the remaining sectors in 
another r/w taskfile.  This doubles the interrupts on the affected 
chipset/drive combos, but still allows large requests.  I'm not terribly 
fond of partial completions, as I feel they add complexity, particularly 
so in my case:  I can simply use the same error paths for both the 
single-sector taskfile and the "everything else" taskfile, regardless of 
which taskfile throws the error.
(thinking out loud)  Though best for simplicity, I am curious if a 
succession of "tiny/huge" transaction pairs are efficient?  I am hoping 
that the drive's cache, coupled with the fact that each pair of 
taskfiles is sequentially contiguous, will not hurt speed too much over 
a non-errata configuration...
