I guess it should move the whole stack if / is overmounted, and
perhaps only the top-level if /new_root is. For /put_old, things
would just be added to the stack. Anyway, details depend on the
overmounting implementation. It should be pretty straightforward
to adapt the dentry juggling.

Typically, if you have a lot of unruly processes, you can't unmount the
old root anyway. So in this case, it's probably better to forget about
pivot_root and to do a simple chroot. Or, if all else fails, reboot.
