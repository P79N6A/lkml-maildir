I am trying to find out if I am the only one who has pppd drop packets 
as bogus when the port is set at 115Kbps.  I only get it at that speed. 
  It causes stall outs etc.
There may be a possibility this is machine specific, because if it is 
meant to forward the packet to the internal net and I slow the machine 
down (external cache off) it works fine, turn the cache back on and it 
is a problem.
So, anyway, this is an information seeking trip.
