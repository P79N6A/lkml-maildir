I had a similar problem, but solved that with an upgrade of alsa-lib.
I've been following this thread, because apparently my SB Live! isn't 
supported by ALSA either. I need to use the gnome mixer to affect any change 
in sound levels... Apparently none of the numerous controls offered by 
alsamixer and kmix work.
Attached is the lspci output for the card.

Alsa reports it as "unknown" but functions well. To my knowledge the card came 
as OEM equipment on a Dell XPS-T850r, so I told ALSA to use the "Dell OEM" 
driver in the kernel. Before updating alsa-lib I had the problem with the 
controls. Now all I have is the fact that it seems nothing allows me to 
change the sound level programatically except the gnome mixer.
