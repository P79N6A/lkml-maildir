As far as I can tell, the VFS layer should have done this for us already, 
with code like
		...
                if (!IS_POSIXACL(dir->d_inode))
                        mode &= ~current->fs->umask;
                error = vfs_create(dir->d_inode, path.dentry, mode, nd);
		...
in fs/namei.c (open_namei()).
Which path did you come through that didn't do this? That would be the
real bug, I suspect..
