I gate immutable a try on a loopbacked test fs and it seems to work
fine... No complaints from the kernel, and it wrote to the journal file
upon mount. Copies of the journal file before and after putting a bunch of
files on the fs differed... and attempting to write to or copy over the
journal file was denied even to root. Huzzah!
So if you think you might accidentally overwrite your journal file, give
it a chattr +i and stay safe...
