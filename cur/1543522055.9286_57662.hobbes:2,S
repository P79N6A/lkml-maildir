Disagree.
Kernel has kmod, module has kmod   - automatic load.
Kernel has kmod, module does not   - manual load.
Module has kmod, kernel does not   - manual load.
Module and kernel do not have kmod - manual load.
Perfectly sensible results for all combinations, no need to recompile
modules.  Personally I will not use binary only modules but I have to
accept that some people want to.
