Clear to you, I had to look up the gcc info pages to find out what the
"+" constraint does. :)
Is the "r" constraint available (and reasonable) on all architectures
that GCC targets?

I guess I am reacting to the criticism expressed in this thread
against people who write code which happens to work with a particular
compiler version but for which there is nothing in the standard or
documentation which says that it should work or will continue to work.
It seems to me that the asm is in that category.  If the gcc
maintainers were willing to document that side effect that would make
me more comfortable with it.  But it still seems like using an ax as a
screwdriver to me.

Yes, I'm using -mrelocatable on the relevant files now instead of the
RELOC macro.  But there are still a couple of places where I need to
take a pointer value which is valid when running at the initial
address and adjust it so it will be valid later when running at the
final address.
The broader issue is one of how the kernel can construct pointers from
addresses in general and be sure that gcc won't assume it knows what
the pointer points to.  The kernel needs to be able to do this.

Well, it's a statement expression. :)  Aren't those deprecated these
days?

That gives me no way to turn an address into a pointer.
