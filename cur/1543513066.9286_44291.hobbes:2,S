In preparation of the Origin 2000 port Kanoj has recently implemented a
patch which brings in some NUMA support, but that's about everything that
currently exists.  The O2k has still have memory access times that are 
uniform enough to not completly kill performance even in absence of 
locality optimizations, so for the time being NUMA optiizations aren't
really necessary.  E10k is a crossbar based architecture; therefore it's 
UMA, not NUMA.
More soon on this list, MIPS64 is slowly becoming usable and that means
I'll soon stop MIPS64 work for the Indy and switch over to O2k.
