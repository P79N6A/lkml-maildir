Why do not you do so, then? Note that on uniprocessors, all other tasks are
suspended, so their state does not change in between.
Tasks do not change their state without holding a lock. (There is an exception,
but it is justified.)

So you want to record task state changes? That is better done at the right
places in the kernel rather than traversing the task list repeatedly (the
latter is not that performant).

I would be interested in the background: what do you need to know the task
states for?
