   For example, when compiling fs/minix/file.c
Yes we know that several filesystems will need some work for the new
page cache scheme.  I do have fixes for the minix case pending, which
I'll submit to Linus soon after I dig out the sparc issues.
For now only proc/devpts/nfs/ext2 are usable and will compile.  So
config out everything else if you wish to test out 2.3.7.
Later,
