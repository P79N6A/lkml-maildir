Hmm, there might be even more cases of this. I remember pondering
it when I did the original 4 level work (sometimes we discard higher level 
virtual address bits during walking)

I have. But it will just make them more similar, not completely consolidate
them into an iterator, because that's too hard/ugly to do efficiently.
