Subject: [BENCHMARK] fork_load module tested for contest

I've been trialling a new load module for the contest benchmark
(
http://contest.kolivas.net
) which simply forks a process that does nothing,
waits for it to die, then repeats. Here are the results I have obtained so far:
noload:
Kernel                  Time            CPU             Ratio
2.4.19                  72.90           99%             1.00
2.4.19-ck7              71.55           100%            0.98
2.5.38                  73.86           99%             1.01
2.5.38-mm2              73.93           99%             1.01
fork_load:
Kernel                  Time            CPU             Ratio
2.4.19                  100.05          69%             1.37
2.4.19-ck7              74.65           95%             1.02
2.5.38                  77.35           95%             1.06
2.5.38-mm2              76.99           95%             1.06
ck7 uses O1, preempt, low latency
Preempt=N for all other kernels
Clearly you can see the 2.5 kernels have a substantial lead over the current
stable kernel.
This load module is not part of the contest package yet. I could certainly
change it to fork n processes but I'm not really sure just how many n should be.
Comments?

P.S. Results have negligible differences on repeat testing.
