Christoph , you are sounding even more arrogant than RMS now, which is
quite an achievement, although one you shouldn't be proud of.
"blobs of crap" - in whose opinion. Yours. So you don't want the kernel

censorship and has no place in free software.
If you want to control everything people say and think you might want to
apply from a job at the EU commission instead.
