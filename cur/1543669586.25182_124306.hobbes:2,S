Well, it fills free pagecache memory with swapped pages... ;-)
But at the moment I can not 'feel' any real improvement... :-(
I think the problem is that R/O pages are not written to swap space and so not 
prefetched with my patch. But I will look after it...

OK, I'll do it.

Sorry, but I think I can not. The list_del() needs the value returned by 
radix_tree_lookup(), so I can not kick it... By the way, the only reason for 
the radix tree is to make this list_del() not O(n) for searching the list... 
Do you know how expensive the radix_tree_lookup() is? O(1) or O(log(n))?? For 
my shame I do not really know that data structure... :-(

That's good. I was looking for anything like that but didn't find anything 
fitting in the current sources...

I wanted to do this but don't know which function is the correct one for this. 
But I will search harder... or can you give me a hint?

This may be a good idea...

Yup, but currently it improves nothing very much, as stated above, I think 
first I should implement the R/O pages thing and investigete which part of 
the kernel works against my code and frees some pages after I just filled 
them...
Thank you for helping me with your comments!
