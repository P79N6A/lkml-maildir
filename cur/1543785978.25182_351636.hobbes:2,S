Hellwig, people who write slow file systems should not lecture their
measurably superiors on how to code.  Oh, and I should mention that
other people besides me have measured reiser4, and concluded it is twice
the speed of the other Linux filesystems, so don't go claiming it is
just my benchmarks.   What you are doing is keeping me from doing a real
code review myself by keeping my guys so busy that they don't have time
to review the fixmes I inserted and would insert more of if I thought
they had time for them.   If you were as well suited to doing code
reviews as I am, you would have written a faster file system yourself.  
Anybody can find things to fix in someone else's code, and it can go on
for years if they want it to.  I could get what you do from hiring a
college junior, and if it was a good university I'd probably learn more
from that junior in college than from you.  We are doing work, and you
are getting in the way.  Nobody who wants reiser4 views your
contributions as the least bit positive.  I fear you will delay us until
ext3 can catch up.
What you are is someone who substitutes social connections for technical
ability.  You measurably can't code as well as we can, so once it
conforms to VFS interface requirements, please go away.
