The patch does require concurrent increments and decrements in the main 
fault patch. The potential is to create another bouncing cacheline for 
concurrent faults. This looks like it would cause a performance issue.

Single threaded build? I would suggest to try concurrently faulting memory 
from multiple processors. You may not see this on a kernel build even if 
this is run with -j16 because concurrent faults are rare.
