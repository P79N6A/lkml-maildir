Not only is it unscalable, it almost by definition is anti-social.  The only
times I've actually seen one in the wild, it's because some subscriber to a
mailing list wishes to subvert the list's culture in a manner worse than
a Reply-To: header.  I considered adding support for Mail-Followup-To: to
the exmh MUA, but decided against it, because it would basically mean that
every time I got one, I'd have to curse and moan and put the To: and cc: back
the way everybody *else* on the list wanted those to headers to behave. Kind
of hard to motivate myself to write Tk/Tcl code that will just mean a *worse*
user experience for myself...
