Subject: [patch 2.6.21-rc2-git] reduce rtc syslog spam
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Make the RTC core less noisy.  On fault paths this message is confusing;
and on success, a message from the driver itself should be much more
informative (displaying chip type, options, etc).

It would be nice if this cleanup went into 2.6.21, to reduce that
confusion.  Previous patches cleaned up the per-interface debug
messages, but neglected this one.
