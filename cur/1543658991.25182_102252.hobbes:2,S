Well if you restrict the transport of the protocol to on Network Fabric,
you have a small point.  However moving off the Network stack to MPI
transports is real power of the protocol.  Classic example is the IBM
iSCSI Shark running Linux, and where are the their drivers?  Recall they
are the "Peace, Love, Linux" company.  However, transports like Myrinet,
SCI, Quads, etc ... are the place to be for local SAN banks.
When NIC's or TOEs support native ipsec, have a CRC32C offload core, and a
few other issues them they will have value.
All the ones I have tested or seen, offload the network stack, do not
support ipsec or handle the CRC32C offload.
Only the MPI fabric cards provide the tools desired.
