Doing them as wait queues is the obvious answer: turning
	cli();
	if (cond)
		sleep_on(&cond_list);
into
	current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
	add_wait_queue(&wait, &cond_list);
	if (cond)
		schedule();
	remove_wait_queue(..)
always works, but can often be fairly nasty. 
Especially considering that for performance reasons you usually want to
turn it into
	if (cond) {
		current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
		add_wait_queue(&wait, &cond_list);
		if (cond)
			schedule();
		remove_wait_queue(..)
	}
so that you only do the wait queue stuff if you think you need to.
