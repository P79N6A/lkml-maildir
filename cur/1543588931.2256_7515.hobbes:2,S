with all respect: the problem is that you do not listen.
as people keep trying to point out to you:
- you can have your single-user centric user environment (no logon)
while
- retaining advantages of multi-user security
no kernel changes needed.
ie: you can have your phone's user environment come straight up
(without needing a login or anything) and have security so that the
phone user can't do harmful things like delete system files.
you can have the best of all worlds...
