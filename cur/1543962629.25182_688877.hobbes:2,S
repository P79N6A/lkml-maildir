Actually I like the feature that segfaults and other abort signals are
logged. On Serers where no untrusted multiple users are present this is
helpfull. Freebsd does that for a long time. Besides ratelimiting, we could
make it an runtime sysctl option, but please keep it.
The OP would have never found out about his qmail problem..
