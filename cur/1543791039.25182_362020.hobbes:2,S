Well, unfortuantely, after working along for quite a while with no
problems I ran into another rash of xruns:
13:30:42.524 Audio connection graph change.
subgraph starting at qjackctl-9003 timed out (subgraph_wait_fd=17,
status = 0, state = Finished)
13:49:44.441 XRUN callback (1).

In this case I was not using MythTV. I was building some code as part
of an emerge world, playing some music off a 1394 drive, and chatting
on the Gentoo-ppc IRC.
It seems that my system is not there quite yet.
I took a quick look. If you get a chance where does the NoAccel option
go? Inside of the section for the radeon driver? I'm sure I can find
this online but won't have much of an opportunity for the next few
hours.
Cheers,
Mark
