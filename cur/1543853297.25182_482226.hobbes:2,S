For the most part I agree and if the OSS emulation in ALSA was better I
would agree completely. But the fact that nothing can use /dev/dsp because
the device doesn't do hardware mixing and some apps are already using the
device via ALSA really sucks. Switching drivers is the least painful part
of the process, the real pain comes from having to kill all of the ALSA
apps to be able to use /dev/dsp in either case. I know that this has
been discussed before and no one has come up with a good way to make the
OSS emulation work with ALSA so I won't push the issue. And Doom3's last
patch did include ALSA support so maybe that's a sign that OSS is really
a thing of the past even in closed source apps.
Jim.
