It could be simplified to:
 ((type *)((char *)(ptr) - offsetof(type, member)))
The other bit is just there to throw errors if you cast in a pointer
of the wrong type. To do this, we've got to create a pointer of the
same type as &type.member so that assigning to it without casting will
throw a warning if ptr isn't of the right type. But we can't do
typeof(&type.member), as type is a type name and not an object. So
0 is simply the shortest, safest thing to cast to a (type *).
