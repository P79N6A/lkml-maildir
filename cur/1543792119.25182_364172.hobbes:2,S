Not only that, but as I wrote in my other mail, on some archs, the
system already got all the necessary triggers from the firmware and has
setup sane defaults, in which case it's more up to the driver to either
not care or adapt to what was set (some IRQ controllers don't support
all possible settings for example).
I would also expect PCI drivers to always pass default (rather than
explicitly level negative)
