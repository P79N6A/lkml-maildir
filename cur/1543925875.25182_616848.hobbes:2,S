I don't think the rolling blacklist will catch this, as the rest of the
ACPI code is "correct".
And yes, incorrect information exported by the kernel is not good at
all, especially if a user expects it to work properly :)

Ok, again, I want to see the IBM people sign off on this, after testing
on all of their machines, before I'll consider this, as I know the IBM
acpi tables are "odd".
Also, how about Dell machines?  I know they are probably not expecting
this information to show up and who knows if the numbering of their
slots match up with their physical diagrams (I say this based on all of
the eth0/eth1 "issues" with Dell machines over the years...)

IBM sells a program that does this for server rooms.  It's probably part
of some Tivoli package somewhere, sorry I don't remember the name.  I
did see it working many years ago and it required no kernel changes at
all to work properly.

Not if the slot information is incorrect :)
That's my main concern.
