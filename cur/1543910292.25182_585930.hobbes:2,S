Subject: power off disk drives while running

In embedded system design, it may be useful to poweroff the disks (as opposed
to merely spinning them down).  We want to leave the system running while
the disk is powered down, and let the disk powerup when it needs to be 
spun up.
While the "power off mechanism" would be platform dependent, is there a
generic path to announce "prepare for power going away"?
