   Any idea how much power this saves? And for the vast rest of us who do run X,
   this seems to parallel the work of a well-tuned screensaver.
This is just a notifier; to make it work as a screensaver you'll have to rely
on some external programs. Personally I use smartdimmer to dim my vaio panel.
Obviously you can keep your toaster flying, if you like, simply calling the
flying-toaster module instead of smartdimmer. Anyway I would use the latter on
battery. ;-)
Best,
