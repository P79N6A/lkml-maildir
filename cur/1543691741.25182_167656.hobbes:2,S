For block devices we really have non-trivial properties associated with them -
struct gendisk and request queue, for one thing.  And these are uniform across
the entire set.
Character devices per se have *no* meaningful properties common to the entire
class.  To put it another way, while block devices do form a natural class,
character ones do not.

Yes, if they bother with cdev of their own in the first place.

Umm...  Any kobject has ->release() method, obviously.  NOTE: as always,
embedding kobject into one of your objects requires serious thinking about
lifetime rules for your objects.  Until they are cleaned up you'd better
*not* mess with that.  OTOH, in a lot of cases cleanup is needed anyway -
e.g. if you declare per-object sysctls/procfs entries/whatnot, you have
the same sort of problems already (plus you need to deal with the same
sort of races in your code that finds object by major:minor; many drivers
are FUBAR in that area).
