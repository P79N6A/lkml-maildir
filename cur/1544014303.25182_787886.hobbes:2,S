Yes, the version you attached looks much better, and correct.
Just some minor comments:

Please don't put filenames in top of file comments.  They don't serve

no lines longer than 80 characters please.

Given that hfsplus never sets i_generation it's superflous.  So just
write the above as
	return hfsplus_iget(sb, ino);
And maybe write a little comment that there is no generation number
in hfsplus.

No need for this comment I think.  All this is pretty well documented
in Documentation/filesystems/Exporting, and all the other filesystems
that just fill out these three methods don't comment on it either.
