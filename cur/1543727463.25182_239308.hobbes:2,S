If you're willing to use bk, it's trivial.  Each changeset refers to a
particular state of the tree.  If "bk -r check -acv" reports no errors,
and "bk changes -r+ -d:KEY:" reports a particular key, you are
guaranteed that your tree state matches exactly the state of anyone else
who has that key at any point in the past. [1]
So if the -bkX creation script doesn't already, it should "bk changes
-r+ -d:KEY: > key-bk$X" when it creates the tarball.  Then anyone can
"bk clone -r`cat key-bk7` linux-2.5 linux-2.6-bk7" and duplicate the
-bk7 state of the tree, and then "bk changes -L ../linux-2.6-bk6" to
find the list of changesets differing.

Tagging isn't the answer for snapshots.  Rather, the snapshot metadata
needs to include the cset key at the snapshot instant.
[1] well, caveat -- bk isn't cryptographically secure, so probably a
    motivated attacker could construct a tree which would pass this test
    but have different contents.  This wouldn't allow the attacker to
    push invalid contents to other trees, just to have different
    contents in their tree.
