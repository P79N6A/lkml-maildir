Yes - you want to kill this 11 minute mode in the kernel.
Concerning the messages:
Suppose set_rtc_mmss() is called just before the hour.
Say real_minutes=59 and cmos_minutes=0.
What happens?
        if (abs(real_minutes - cmos_minutes) < 30) {
                if (!(save_control & RTC_DM_BINARY) || RTC_ALWAYS_BCD) {
                        BIN_TO_BCD(real_seconds);
                        BIN_TO_BCD(real_minutes);
                }
                CMOS_WRITE(real_seconds,RTC_SECONDS);
                CMOS_WRITE(real_minutes,RTC_MINUTES);
        } else {
                printk(KERN_WARNING
                       "set_rtc_mmss: can't update from %d to %d\n",
                       cmos_minutes, real_minutes);
                retval = -1;
        }
A message in syslog.
Concerning a hwclock hang:
Did you try "hwclock --directisa"?
For many people that works better than accessing the hardware clock
via /dev/rtc and the kernel.
Concerning the "last I was able to run hwclock it was about 40 minutes off":
There is the silly code
        if (((abs(real_minutes - cmos_minutes) + 15)/30) & 1)
                real_minutes += 30;             /* correct for half hour time zone */
(On the one hand, nobody is in a half hour time zone.
On the other hand, last I was in Nepal the time difference
with China and India was an integral number of hours plus/minus
a quarter of an hour. On the third hand, still other time differences,
like 20 minutes, occur in sufficiently obscure places. This += 30
does not belong in the kernel - as this entire 11 minute business
does not belong in the kernel.)
So when things go a bit wrong, the kernel will add 30 minutes to the
error in the hardware clock.
How could things go a bit wrong? Hmm. There is also /etc/adjtime that
tries to follow the drift of the clock. Bad things will happen if
you set up hwclock to use /etc/adjtime and simultaneously have this
11 minute mode. Wild fluctuations may be the result.
