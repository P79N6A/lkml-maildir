People,
Somehow I must have lost my brain.
In exit.c I introduced some array:
pid_t pidarray[100];
in fork.c I refer to this array:
extern pid_t pidarray[100];
(or something like that. looked it up in K&R, couldn't
find what I did wrong)
for some reason the kernel build process complains
about the pidarray it could not find.
This is a very trivial problem, but, well, I'm not
seing it. Tried to move the declaration to some
header-file, etc. etc. Done it all, doesn't work.
Anyone who can shed some light on this problem?
