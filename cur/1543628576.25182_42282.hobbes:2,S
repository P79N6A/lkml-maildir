Then I've got good news for you: Jari Ruusu just sent me a patch to the
loop device that fixes the problem!
As loop-AES has a super-set of features of the original loop device,
you may download loop-AES 1.6b here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=28891&release_id=84590
... and replace the loop.c-2.4.diff file in it with the attached new version.
Or wait until there's an official new loop-AES release or until the maintainer
of the original loop.c applied a similar patch.
