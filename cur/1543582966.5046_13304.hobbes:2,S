"Unfortunately" the cache also contains _process memory_ in
Linux. Limiting the cache to 10% also means limiting the
code size of all your processes to something smaller than
that.
Also, read-in swap pages are in the so-called swap cache,
which is also part of the page cache.
This means that simple limits on cache size probably won't do
much good on Linux.
