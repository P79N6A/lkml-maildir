Please provide a complete and detailed changelog message for each
patch and an introductory email explaining the top-level purpose of
these changes.
Yes, I personally know what these changes are all about, but not
everyone does.
Sending a bunch of non-descript patches to the list is always a very
bad idea, and will result in little, if any, patch review.
