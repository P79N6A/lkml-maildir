   Was this posted to the list?  I remember Troy's results showing positive
   results with TSO over SPECWeb.  
   
Mala Anand (manand@us.ibm.com) has continually been disabling TSO in
2.5.x performance tests, at least this is how it has appeared to me.
Please, you two have a dialogue together and sort this out :-)
