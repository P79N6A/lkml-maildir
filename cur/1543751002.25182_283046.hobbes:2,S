I think I am seeing this problem too.  It doesn't just apply to RT
tasks, it seems that CPU bound tasks starve each other.  I noticed that
with the RT kernel, a kernel compile or dpkg will starve evolution, to
the point where it takes 30 seconds to display a message.  If I go and
background the CPU hog, the message renders _instantly_.
It's definitely present with 2.6.10-rc2 + RT (PK config) and absent with
2.6.10 vanilla.  I need to figure out whether -mm has the problem.
