Hi all:
   I have a ide device which need use special command to configure it.
I want to write a user space program to control it. 
so I try to use ioctl send my command, but after I send IDE command
I must send 512byte to device. 
does anyone know how to write data from user space?
and I have another question, 
    what is "hwif->drives[0].unmask = 1;", how to use it correctly?
