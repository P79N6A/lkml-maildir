That part shouldn't be too hard: most of the parameters passed from
setup.S to the main kernel are passed in a parameter block; one option
is to enter the new kernel at the 32-bit entry point and simply skip
setup.
However, this doesn't guarantee that the new kernel isn't going to choke
on the hardware configuration, which is going to be radically different
than a machine that has been booted from reset.

Right, but I don't think it solves any real problem, however.  What I
was trying to do was to see if you could run a Linux kernel on top of
the BIOS; it certainly is doable (Ross Biro did such an implementation
back in 1994), but I ended up believing that it was more trouble than
it's worth... in no small part because the things you have to break in
order to keep the BIOS alive pretty much breaks the native device
drivers in more-or-less subtle ways, because Linux likes to reconfigure
the hardware to act sanely.
Hence, it is not so much the BIOS interface that's the problem, but the
fact that Linux really likes to break the BIOS, and break it pretty
hard.
