Subject: select returning slow on RH 2.4.18-14 (RH 8.0) kernel.

I've been doing some testing with RH 8.0 on an Ezra 800Mhz
machine.
Even when lightly loaded select() often returns 3-9 miliseconds slower
than the timeout would suggest.  I know select is not guaranteed to
return with < 10ms accuracy, but with almost no load, shouldn't it
at least return with 1ms accuracy on average?
I don't remember having this problem on other machines and RH 7.3....
Anyone seen this problem?
Compiling a stock 2.4.20 kernel for the Ezra CPU now to see if that
helps anything...
Thanks,
Ben
