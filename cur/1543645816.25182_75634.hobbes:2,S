Undefined Behaviour. I can easily imagine cases where, depending
on the calling convention and the actual return type, things could
go very very wrong. Consider struct returns...
This case, returning an int to a caller expecting void, is likely
to work on most normal machines -- the int would go into a GP result
register, and the GP result register is typically always part of the
caller-save set. The code is still utter crap, however.
