Subject: [patch] Real-Time Preemption, -RT-2.6.13-rc4-V0.7.52-01
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

i have released the -V0.7.52-01 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be 
downloaded from the usual place:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this release is mainly a merge to 2.6.13-rc4. (That merge slashed ~30K 
off the patch, due to the continuing merge of various bits of the -RT 
tree to mainline.)
to build a -V0.7.52-01 tree, the following patches should to be applied:
   
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.12.tar.bz2
   
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.13-rc4.bz2

reports, patches, suggestions welcome.
