Hi,
this patch fixes a sles9 system hang in start_this_handle from a
customer with some heavy workload where all tasks are waiting on
kjournald to commit the transaction, but kjournald waits on t_updates
to go down to zero (it never does). This was reported as a lowmem
shortage deadlock but when checking the debug data I noticed the VM
wasn't under pressure at all (well it was really under vm pressure,
because lots of tasks hanged in the VM prune_dcache methods trying to
flush dirty inodes, but no task was hanging in GFP_NOFS mode, the
holder of the journal handle should have if this was a vm issue in the
first place). No task was apparently holding the leftover handle in
the committing transaction, so I deduced t_updates was stuck to 1
because a journal_stop was never run by some path (this turned out to
be correct). With a debug patch adding proper reverse links and stack
trace logging in ext3 deployed in production, I found journal_stop is
never run because mark_inode_dirty_sync is called inside release_task
called by do_exit. (that was quite fun because I would have never
thought about this subtleness, I thought a regular path in ext3 had a
bug and it forgot to call journal_stop)
do_exit->release_task->mark_inode_dirty_sync->schedule() (will never
come back to run journal_stop)
The reason is that shrink_dcache_parent is racy by design (feature not
a bug) and it can do blocking I/O in some case, but the point is that
calling shrink_dcache_parent at the last stage of do_exit isn't safe
for self-reaping tasks.
I guess the memory pressure of the unbalanced highmem system allowed
to trigger this more easily.
Now mainline doesn't have this line in iput (like sles9 has):
    	     if (inode->i_state & I_DIRTY_DELAYED)
	     			mark_inode_dirty_sync(inode);
so it will probably not crash with ext3, but for example ext2
implements an I/O-blocking ext2_put_inode that will lead to similar
screwups with ext2_free_blocks never coming back and it's definitely
wrong to call blocking-IO paths inside do_exit. So this should fix a
subtle bug in mainline too (not verified in practice though). The
equivalent fix for ext3 is also not verified yet to fix the problem in
sles9 but I don't have doubt it will (it usually takes days to crash,
so it'll take weeks to be sure).
An alternate fix would be to offload that work to a kernel thread, but
I don't think a reschedule for this is worth it, the vm should be able
to collect those entries for the synchronous release_task.
