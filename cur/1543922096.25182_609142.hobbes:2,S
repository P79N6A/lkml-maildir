It was intended to be something like /proc/sys/kernel/ only.

We already have /sys/fs/ ?

We will merge the nonsense of "block/", "class/" and "bus/" to one
"subsystem". The block, class, bus directories will only be kept as
symlinks for compatibility. Then every subsystem has a directory like:
/sys/subsystem/block/, /sys/subsystem/net/ and the devices of the
subsystem are in a devices/ directory below that. Just like the
/sys/bus/< name>/devices/ layout looks today. All subsystem-global
tunables can go below the /sys/subsystem/<name>/ directory, without
clashing with the list of devices or anything else.

Unfortunately, there was never really a guideline.

True, just looking at it now, people do crazy things like:
/sys/kernel/notes, which is a file with binary content, and a name
nobody will ever be able to guess what it is good for. That should
definitely go into a section/ directory.  Also the VM stuff there
should probably move to a /sys/vm/ directory along with the weird
placed top-level /sys/slab/.
Thanks,
