D'oh.  You are right.  I misread the code in the middle of the night.  I
came across the new issue of hitting the sigpending limit while verifying a
test case for timers leaking.  I failed to realize that it's the timer leak
itself that translates into a sigpending count leak.
Indeed, ignore that patch, and wait for the posix-timers leak fix coming soon.
Thanks,
Roland
