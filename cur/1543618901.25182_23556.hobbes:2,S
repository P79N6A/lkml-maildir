Suppose vmware decides to switch between running Linux and its virtualised
Windows OS. Can it do this during an interrupt - if so what ensures that
vmware isnt switched to after we have done APM idle calls and slowed the
CPU right down ?
If so then I suspect vmware should be issuing APM cpu busy calls itself
