With this patch, early boot would use pages from lower PFNs. Without the
patch, it would use memory from higher PFNs. That is the only real
difference.
1. Is there any chance that all of your memory is not being properly
   initialised?
2. Any chance of seeing a dmesg log?
3. If you boot with the patch reverted and then do something to consume
all memory like build loads of kernel trees simultaneously, do you see
any problems?
