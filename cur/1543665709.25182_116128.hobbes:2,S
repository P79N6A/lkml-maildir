Is the tg3 driver's remove() function actually being called?  In looking
at the driver, the callback is declared properly, so it should be
present when building the driver into the kernel.

I have no idea right now, sorry.
Only thing I can think of is you have to mark the remove function as
"__devexit" and not "__exit" to make sure the function is really there
if CONFIG_HOTPLUG is enabled.
