But anyways.  My objects were it's not just "macs".  And not all keyboards
have "F13" written on them as well as Print Screen.  Which is why I think
what 2.2 has is what 2.4 should have.  Or if yours doesn't say Print Screen:
On PowerPC - You press 'ALT-Print Screen (or F13)-<command key>
As to weather or not it's the key which says "ALT" on it or not, it is the
key which provides the ALT keycode in linux.  Or it very well should be, for
consistencys sake.
