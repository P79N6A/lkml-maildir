Well what they get is hardware accelerated 3d graphics under Linux.
If they didn't need 3d, they can use the open source drivers.
If someone downloads and installs the drivers themselves, they should
know enough to contact nvidia for support (I think nvidia have been
pretty good). Others will contact their ditro support.
There might be a problem where they percieve that Linux is unstable
while it is actually binary drivers.

I must say that I've been using the same nvidia drivers on my desktop
system for maybe a year, and never had a crash including going through
countless versions of 2.5/6. True you need to recompile the intermediate
layer, but then, nobody who knows less than me will know or care about
kernel versions. Their distro will upgrade kernel+drivers if needed, and
presumably the distro has done some sort of testing / QA.
