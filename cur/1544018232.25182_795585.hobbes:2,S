Ingo,
These patches are fixes for the wakeup tracer.
The first is a fix to the empty output you reported to me earlier.
The second is a fix for the ring buffer to not record updates
if it is disabled, otherwised you can get empty traces there too.
The third is the wakeup change to record all tasks and not just
realtime tasks. It adds a wakeup_rt tracer to record only rt tasks.
The forth is the addition of the scheduling wakeup and sched switch
output to the wakeup tracer. This is very helpful data.
The last is probably the most important, and should go into 29 as well.
I never reset the timestamps used to connect the trace stamps in
the buffers. This can cause stale stamps to appear and explains
some of the really bad timestamps in the buffer I've seen.
