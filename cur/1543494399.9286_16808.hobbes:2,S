Hi guys,
sorry for the later anwer but I was out for the week-end.
I've readed Mark article and all Ingo answers, They speak about low level
system implementations that are very interesting for me but, the _really_
question for Mark is :
Can You explain to me why I've to reboot my NT 4.0 SP4 ( low charged )
server
every 48-72 hours becouse It stop responding to every networks queries ?
and more :
Why the _only_ reason to stop my Linux 2.2.x server is due a kernel change ?
Best Regards,
        Davide Libenzi.
