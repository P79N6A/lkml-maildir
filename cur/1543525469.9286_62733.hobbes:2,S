Hi,
     Well, yes and no. I guess my fundamental claim is that if 
userland is able to generate requests faster than the driver can 
fulfill them for an extended period of time then we've got a larger 
problem than worrying about a particular request taking a long time 
to satisfy. Indeed, I claim that as long as the driver cannot keep up 
there will always be a pathological case where a particular request 
is unreasonably delayed.
     I'm not saying I have any idea what the correct solution is, but 
I feel that tackling the request scheduling problem is less 
meaningful if we haven't at least taken a whack at solving the 
request overrun problem.
	Cheers,
	Bruce.
