Boil or not - I've done a test some years ago with some friend
arguing about what the best temperature for tea is. Result of an
experiment involving actual temperature sensors: my default tea is 40
deg celsius. Theirs was about 60. And to note, drinking 60 deg water
already starts to scald my tongue slightly so that it 'itches' for a
while. So nothing[1] is unreasonable.
