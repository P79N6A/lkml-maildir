Well yes, but all that other junk is carefully redirected to other files,
I do like to reserve dmesg and kern.log entries for exceptional kernel
problems (like the scsi failures that crop up on at least one box a
year..). 400 was a bit of a conservative estimate too:
saens{jgg}/var/log#wc --lines --bytes kern.log
   1560  114770 kern.log
saens{jgg}/var/log#grep -i pkt_too_big kern.log | wc -l
   1176
saens{jgg}/var/log#grep -i "last message repeated" kern.log | wc -l
    381
Heh, only thing in that file is that one message :>
Thanks,
Jason
