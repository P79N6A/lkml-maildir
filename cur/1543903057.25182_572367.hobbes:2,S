This is more sane and readable.

As I said two lines furter down, I think these defines are nice. Will
adding bit-field descriptors make the SSC driver more usable by the AT91
people?
I guess there is also the possibility to include the ARM headers for
that architecture and use the definitions in the header file for AVR32.
