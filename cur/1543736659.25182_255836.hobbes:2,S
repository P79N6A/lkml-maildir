yes for suspend/resume it should work. it will have the only advantage
of not having to ask the password during suspend or during boot, it will
only ask the "resueme" password during resume and the first time you
create the public key for resume to write it in the harddisk encrypted
with such passphrase as . as usual it'll be as Wolfgang suggested.
But why did you quote the above? for cryptoswap it cannot work, for
cryptoswap there's no reason to ever ask the user to anything and it
must read and write all the time anyways, it's not like suspend
write-only and resume read-only, a problem where public/private
encryption can fit.

my point is that you would not be allowed to give anyone ssh access to
your machine (assuming you trust local security). If he gets ssh access,
then he could as well stole the laptop and read the encrypted data.
But if calling set_fs(KERNEL_DS); sys_read(0) sounds troublesome, you
could also erase the password from the cmdline, and you would still
pass the passphrase via bootloader. I'd recommend not to make it visible
to userspace.

that should be trivial to reverse, no?
