Yeah, but a name in each file is much nicer.

Thanks for pointing this out. 
One comment, the file drivers/infiniband/core/cache.c has a license that
is illegal due to the contents of the file.  Please change the license
of the file to GPL only.
Oh, and how about kernel-doc comments for all functions that are
EXPORT_SYMBOL() marked?  And for your core big structures?
thanks,
