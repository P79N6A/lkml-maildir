The first step here shouldn't be too difficult. Just create a _read
function that uses your code to return monotonic TSC cycles (instead of
nanoseconds w/ gettimeofday).  Then just create a clocksource structure
for it.
The harder part will be the vsyscall, as you will need extra per cpu
data in the vsyscall read. I had some test code for this situation
awhile back, so if you get the first part functioning correctly (just a
clocksource w/o a vread pointer), I'll gladly help you get the vsyscall
bits working.
thanks
