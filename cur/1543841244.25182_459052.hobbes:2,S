This is not entirely true...
All architectures sets saved_command_line variable...
So I can add __init to the saved_command_line and
copy its contents into kmalloced persistence_command_line at
main.c.
Then the following files should be modified to use the new kmalloced variable:
./drivers/sbus/char/openprom.c: char *buf = saved_command_line;
./fs/proc/kcore.c:      strncpy(prpsinfo.pr_psargs, saved_command_line, ELF_PRARGSZ);
./fs/proc/proc_misc.c:  len = sprintf(page, "%s\n", saved_command_line);
Have I got it right?
