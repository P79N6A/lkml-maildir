Is there anyway to unbind a socket after you killed a program with -9 by
accedent.  like if you kill inetd and it has some child process's runing
and you kill the children, the process seems to have left sockets in
SYN_WAIT etc.  Normally you have to reboot or wait around 10 minutes for
it to clear, any way to clear it then and there?  Would be handy for
programs like bnc that bind the socket for ages.
Cheers
