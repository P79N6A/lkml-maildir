Hi!
 Compiling different, more low level located things like nmap, pppd etc
 I have got warnings about a doubly/redefined defined symbol:
   /usr/include/bits/resource.h:109: warning: `RLIM_INFINITY' redefined
   /usr/include/asm/resource.h:25: warning: this is the location of the previous...
 Additionally it seems to me, that the straight forward symbol links from
 /usr/src/linux/include...(and subs) to /usr/include are no longer valid.
 I have grepped the kernel sources for a hint but didn't found anything
 useful. WHAT is currently symlinked ffrom the kernel source? 
 I am using 
 linux-2.3.40
 libc-2.1.2 (glibc6)
 gcc-2.95.2
 Thank you very much for any help in advance!
  KEEP HACKING!
