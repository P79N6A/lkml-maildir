Around and around we go - I'm seeing why Victor is sick of this.  A few
words of advice and then I hope we're done with this thread because I
don't know what else can be said which hasn't been said before.

I read your whole posting carefully, a couple of times.  You're basically 
asking for free legal advice from a party whom with you compete, may possibly
sue, and/or may be sued by.  Do you seriously expect answers or are you
just posturing?  Rhetorical question, please don't answer it.
