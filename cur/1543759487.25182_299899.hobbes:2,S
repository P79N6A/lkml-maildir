Can we please come to a consensus about GEN_FL_REMOVABLE.  After
talking to other kernel developers, particularly in the block
interface area, I am convinced that it is fundamentally incorrect

Unfortunately, it appears that you're not convinced.  This needs
resolving since it is an interface issue.
