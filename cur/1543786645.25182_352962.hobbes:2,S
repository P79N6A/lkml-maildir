Done. If this isn't what you want, tell me so.

Marking patches as good or bad is separated from applying/reverting.
You can edit "series-bisect-mm" manually, then do "./bisect-mm apply"
and it will change tree to the new middle point.
Manual editing boils down to:
			    .--> "good fix-typo.patch"
	"fix-typo.patch" --<
			    `--> "bad fix-typo.patch"
