Ditto - CryoPID.

I agree that some processes are, but the majority are not.

Not that hard. Most of the information, if not exported by the
kernel through other means, can be ascertained from within the
process itself. For example, FD offsets can be obtained with lseek,
network connection endpoints with get{sock,peer}name, etc. With a
little help from ptrace, it's trivial.

Remote syscalls is how CryoPID does it. Inject some code into the
target and execute it. CryoPID can also scrape out the contents of
unlinked (eg, temporary) files (in svn version). You can establish
what FIFOs joined which FDs of what processes through /proc, and
capture the in-flight buffers with some more ptracing.

Just for file offsets? I disagree =)

TCP connections can be done with tcpcp (tcpcp.sf.net) and CryoPID
already supports it (although the patch hasn't been ported past
2.6.11).
UDP connections are not a hassle being stateless (though CryoPID
doesn't yet, because it's too easy :)
Unix sockets can be reconnected, but of course protocols might get
hopelessly confused. However, I am working with the Gtk+ display
migration code to freeze Gtk+ applications. gtk-demo freezes quite
happily as does gvim. The Gtk+ guys are working hard to squash some
remaining bugs to make more apps supported.
However with some prethought, you could hook your X app up to
something like Xmove and migrate any X application that way.

The contents are not so much an issue, as the ids themselves. They
face much the same problem as PIDs - you attach/detach to a SHM
segment by its shmid. These are allocated by the kernel, but cached
in the process. Some method of requesting a particular shmid would
make life easier for checkpointing. Ditto semaphores and message
queues.

For many processes, there isn't all that much that can't be saved
from userspace. Help from kernel space would certainly make things
easier/faster/more reliable. This task_pid API being one of them.

Fair enough.  I'm actually implementing multithreading support for
CryoPID at the moment.  It currently resumes with the original PIDs
by editing last_pid in /dev/kmem and forking - a temporary racy
hack, until a better solution (such as this) appeared.  (It fails if
the PID is in use, or if anybody else on the system fork()s before
you do).  I'll give the task_pid patches a try and see how much
easier life is.
I'm delighted to see Serge and the vserver guys putting the time
into this! Thanks!

Bernard.
