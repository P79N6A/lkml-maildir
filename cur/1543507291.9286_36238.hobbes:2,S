Subject: [PROBLEM] No ARP answer when two ifaces with same IP exist (2.2.x)

	Hi,
        When there are 2 interfaces dummy0 and eth0:1 (in this order) with
same IP and dummy is DOWN, there is no ARP response from eth0:1
	In net/ipv4/arp.c:arp_rcv() the code:
	if ((tdev = ip_dev_find(tip)) && (tdev->flags & IFF_NOARP))
	must be changed to ignore interfaces which are down, i.e.
IFF_UP checking is required but the change is very complex.
	ip_dev_find() is used in some other places and may be
IFF_UP checking is required.
	Or may be the user must assign different IP when iface (dummy0)
is down ?
Regards,
Julian Anastasov
