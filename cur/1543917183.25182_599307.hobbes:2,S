i.e., what is this binary blob  (?)
I don't see a binary blob in this patch (as stated in the first
sentence).  I'd say that this patch adds methods for exporting
(or exposing) the ibft thru sysfs.
Is there some good reason that the iSCSI connection information
shouldn't be exposed in real sysfs attribute files instead of just
in a binary file?
