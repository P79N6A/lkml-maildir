Well, that's a different discussion, really. Is fixing the body of
[v]printk() enough? I don't think it's possible if you want to do
everything that I described in my original post.
It's not even an optimization from my point of view; I think Joe
Perches was arguing that code should be kept short. I was arguing that
it's already shorter than with the current situation.
