Another example - Same thing happened with ECN. I recall setting up a mail 
server at the time and noticing that I had to disable ECN because some 
dumbass PIX routers out there were dropping packets with a _reserved bit_ 
set! Sure, there was a firmware upgrade, but the dingbat admins I tried to 
alert didn't seem (at the time) too interested in fixing their problem.
Does anyone have any interesting statistics on how often end-users are 
likely to run into this crap? It really is a shame when you have to suck just 
because someone else does.
