Look, I've been using various modems for many years, starting with
self-made 300 bps one and there were basically 3 options:
- no flow control at all (no buffering etc), RTS/CTS disabled/missing,
- XON/XOFF flow control, RTS/CTS disabled/missing,
- RTS/CTS handshaking with RTS = modem can send to computer (with
  option to ignore RTS) and CTS = computer can send to modem.

VT100 and printers are DTE, connections between DTE (without help
of DCE) are obviously non-standard.

Circuit 105 - Request to send
Direction: To DCE
Signals on this circuit control the data channel transmit function
of the DCE. The ON condition causes the DCE to assume the data channel
transmit mode. The OFF condition causes the DCE to assume the data
channel non-transmit mode, when all data transferred on circuit 103
have been transmitted.
What do you think are "data channel transmit mode" and "non-transmit"
mode? Obviously the standard doesn't know if it's a radiomodem, RS-485
style multipoint bus or something else but it's clearly half-duplex -
full-duplex devices are always in "transmit" and "receive" mode
simultaneously.
Does your modem drop carrier when RTS goes?
V.24 assumes DTE is always able to receive data. While it's probably
the case with PC and Linux, it may not be true with all DTE. With
strict V.24 DTE has not way to say "I can't take data, stop
transmitting". Now imagine connecting a serial printer to a PC
with a pair of DCE.

Great, meanwhile we don't have it here, but that only means nobody
is really interested in it.

Which modems, exactly? Normal modems work perfectly fine with current
CRTSCTS and this RTS toggling could only confuse them.
A flag alone is no help for half-duplex devices, they would need
a complete handshaking code.
