Certainly not.  Only subsystems that want to use emergency pools will get
more complicated.  If you have a suggestion as to how to implement a
similar feature that is completely transparent to its users, I would *love*
to hear it.  I have tried to keep the changes to implement this
functionality to a minimum.  As the patches currently stand, existing slab
allocator and mempool users can continue using these subsystems without
modification.

Again, I could not find any way to implement this functionality without
forcing the users of the functionality to make some, albeit very minor,
changes.  Specific suggestions are more than welcome! :)
Thanks!
