True, with that patch it's passing back less info than 2.5.47 tried to do;
but no less than 2.5.46 and earlier, which always returned desc.error and
ignored the desc.written, desc.count coming back from do_generic_file_read.
So it's not a regression, but of course you're right that it's weak.

Thanks, that gets it going again.  I'll step aside and leave the correct
partial handling to those who know loop much better than I - Adam?
