The problem is that a select operation on a non bool/tristate symbol is 
undefined. A runtime error would probably be even more ignored than this.
"Proving" that this select can't be activated is theoretically possible, 
but not really practical. An alternative might be to reverse the 
dependency again and let it act like a "depends on".
Just removing the warning is definitely not the right answer.
bye, Roman
