procfs should be okay.  sysfs was too intertwined with driver model and
module reference counting never worked well.  We had to pull module
reference counting out of there.

No, I don't think so.  The code won't go away beneath it.  After
module_put() the module can die (ie. calling __module_get() on it will
trigger BUG) but it won't go away till the function finishes.
