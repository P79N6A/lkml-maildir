If I would have had this in mind, I would have written "chance". Users
have the chance, if they stumble over reiserfs, but they do not have the
choice, because they are not asked.
Compare this to some dictatures... say Serbia. Most people have the
chance to change the political system (they can try to form opposition
and demonstrate, etc.), but they do not have the choice, because they
have no democratic elections.
