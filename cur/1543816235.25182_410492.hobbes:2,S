Hmm... Could we get the mark_buffer_dirty/mark_inode_dirty logic
right?  Probably create a list in the stubbed journal functions and
then mark them dirty in the journal close?  However, half the reason
I'm working on ext2 is the simplicity of the code - stubbing it out
would solve the performance problem but not the complexity problem.
Note that ext3's habit of clearing indirect blocks on truncate would
break some things I want to do in the future. (Insert secret plans
here.)
