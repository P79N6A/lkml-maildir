(Sorry for the delay; just moved to Portland these last couple of
weeks.)
It is a cross-chunk reference - we can't calculate the correct link
count for the target file unless we have a quick way to get all the
directory entries pointing to an inode.  My current scheme is to
create a continuation inode for the directory in the chunk containing
the inode (if the chunk containing the inode is full, create new
continuation inodes for both in a new chunk).
