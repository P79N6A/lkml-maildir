Wrong! Existing external modules build fine when specified an object
directory.

How long have you recommended building external modules like this:
 make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build modules SUBDIRS=`pwd`
  or
 make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build modules M=`pwd`
Now they all have to be changed to:
 make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/source modules SUBDIRS=`pwd`
  or
 make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/source modules M=`pwd`
And the worst part is that modules that have to support old and new
kernel versions have to first detect which method to use, and
select method that applies to that paricular kernel version.

That patch only breaks stuff. Please use the 'object' symlink
suggested by Måns Rullgård. That does not break anything.
