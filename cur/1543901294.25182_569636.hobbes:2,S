How are you going to achieve this without (a) having hibernation-aware
user space or (b) the freezer?

Because, for example, on my machine the status of power supply (present
vs not present) is not updated correctly after the restore if ACPI callbacks
aren't used during the hibernation.  That's just experience and it's in line
with the ACPI spec.

Yes, it is, but that's not we who's mixing.  We just need to handle some
systems built with ACPI in mind.
