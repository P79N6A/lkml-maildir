It appears that recent RH build initrd files w/o all of the stuff in
modules.conf. Perhaps only the first SCSI adaptor, perhaps just ignoring
the ones which don't match the build hardware. I suspect the latter, since
even using --with= in a manual mkinitrd failed (silently) to include the
modules. I can't tell you how much that sucks if you build kernels for
multiple machines on a compile server.
Also, I installed 2.4.18-18.8.0 and it put a bunch of overlong label=
statements in lilo.conf, then ran lilo and didn't check the status. Since
it had deleted the old kernel that left a totally unbootable system. Guess
RH really likes grub and only tests upgrades and such with that.
I will report this later tonight when I'm willing to take the time to
prepare a proper bug report.
