This is a great point; spam on linux-kernel, of all places, is notable 
by what it looks like.  Subject headers don't look right, and the 
content bears very little resemblance to l-k ham.  Maybe hand-filtering 
is catching the stuff that appears adapted to spoof legitimate kernel 
mail, but if so, it has a great track record.  Spammers don't seem to be 
targeting linux-kernel patterns.  Heck, I can train thunderbird to 
filter spam correctly by content for linux-kernel.  Bayesian works well. 
  Since it runs through Yahoo first, I often have to fight Yahoo for my 
legitimate email; that may change my mileage.  However, the other 
notable characteristic is the fact that this list ignores spam.  If it 
has a reply, it may be a flame, it may be a troll, but it hasn't ever 
been spam in my experience.
Why pursue brokenness unless it's your last resort?  You can break a lot 
of eggs without making anything edible, let alone an omelette.
