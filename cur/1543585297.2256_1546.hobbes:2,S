I found a case where pre5 will forget to unlock the page_table_lock (in
copy_page_range()), and one place where I had missed the lock altogether
(in ioremap()), so I'll make a pre6 (neither is a problem on UP, though,
so pre5 is not unusable - even on SMP it works really well until you hit
the case where it forgets to unlock ;).
Although I'd prefer to see somebody check out the other architectures, to
do the (pretty trivial) changes to make them support properly threaded
page faults. I'd hate to have two pre-patches without any input from other
architectures..
