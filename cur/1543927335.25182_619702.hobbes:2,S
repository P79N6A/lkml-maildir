Hi Pierre,
My card driver needed to set the R/W E4MI bit in the Card Capability
register (0x08) in CCCR (function 0). Perhaps it is unnecessary ?
BTW. It is easy to for the card driver to access function 0 registers by
doing the following...
...
	int old_num = func->num;   /* note the current function number */
	/* force access to function 0 area */
	func->num = 0;
	/* enable the e4mi in the card capability register */
	x = sdio_readb(func, 0x000008, &ret);
	if ( ret == 0 ) {
		x |= 0x20;
		sdio_writeb(func, x, 0x000008, &ret);
	}
	/* restore to original function number */
	func->num = old_num; 
...
Regards,
Dean.
