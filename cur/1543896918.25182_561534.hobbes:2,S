Yes, unless we pass signalfd to another process.

Note that exec() can change ->sighand as well, so in general this can't help.
Currently not a problem, exec() detaches process from signalfd anyway.
This reminds me, we have a similar problem with !CPUCLOCK_PERTHREAD()
cpu-timers, iirc. They can survive after exec(), but only if it was
->group_leader who does exec.
