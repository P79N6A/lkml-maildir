Note that this 'struct container_group *' pointer is in addition to the
'struct nsproxy *' pointer already in task_struct. If the set of tasks
over which resorce control is applied is typically the same set of tasks
which share the same 'struct nsproxy *' pointer, then IMHO 'struct
container_group *' in each task_struct is not very optimal.
