 The I/O APIC NMI watchdog utilizes the property of being transparent to a
single IRQ source of a specially reconfigured 8259A PIC (the master one in
the IA32 PC architecture).  There are more prerequisites that have to be
met and all indeed are for a 100% compatible PC as specified by the
Intel's Multiprocessor Specification.
1. The INT output of the master 8259A PIC has to be connected to the LINT0
(or LINTIN0; the name varies by implementations) inputs of all local APICs
in the system.
2a. The OUT0 output of the 8254 PIT (IOW the timer source) has to be 
directly connected to the INTIN2 input of the first I/O APIC.
2b. Alternatively the INT output of the master 8259A PIC has to be
connected to the INTIN0 input of the first I/O APIC.
3. There must be no glue logic that would change logical properties of the
signal between the INT output of the master 8259A PIC and the respective
APIC interrupt inputs.
In practice, assuming the MP IRQ routing information provided the BIOS has
been correct (which is not always the case), prerequisites #1 and #2 have
been met so far, but #3 has proved to be occasionally problematic.
