Someone else mentioned the problem in a different context, so
this report isn't exactly new...  LOTS of unresolved symbols in
several SCSI modules.  Here's the list for "st.o":
scsi_unregister_module
scsi_block_when_processing_errors
scsi_release_request
scsi_do_req
scsi_allocate_request
print_req_sense
scsi_register_module
scsi_ioctl
Other modules I'm personally having problems with are "sg.o" and
"sr_mod.o".  I'll have a look and see if there's a quick fix if
someone doesn't beat me to the punch.
