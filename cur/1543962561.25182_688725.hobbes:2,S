Umm... is it too late to change your chip design?
Seriously, for example on PowerPC 440SPe (which has a PCIe bus on a
32-bit PowerPC core), I don't know any way you can generate a 64-bit PCI
transaction.  Even on 32-bit x86 I think you're stuck using something
ugly like MMX to do it.
Basically it's going to be architecture-dependent at best.
