That part I know very well :)

I like the vDSO interface.

yes. some sample implementation will be good here.  I'll try.

I'm not sure smaller libnuma would have gone too far at that time.
Though in this case you are starting small by just giving the vgetcpu
system call. And then we are going to look at other exportable data.

/proc et.al just add overhead in retrieving this information. For things
that are easily available in kernel vDSO will help.

It just does not sound like a right interface.  Why should an app be
giving the last time value that it asked for the same information.  User
wants cpu, package and node numbers and those are the three parameters
that should be there.  Besides if we are using lsl then the latency part
of cpuid is already gone so no need to optimize this any more.
Though this will be good interface to export jiffies ;-)
