OK, various clean ups made, and enough of the SiS code included that I think 
it should work, plus one change to the i810 interrupt handler that will 
(hopefully) render the other change you made to get_dma_addr and drain_dac 
unnecessary.  If people could please download and test the new 0.14 version 
of the driver on my site, I would appreciate it.
