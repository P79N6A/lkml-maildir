Freedom is something that has to be perpetuated and guaranteed, which is 
what the GPL does. The BSD approach is this: "We're offering you this free 
(as in freedom) software which you can then use and redistribute as 
proprietary software as long as we get credit."
This is like drawing up a constitution for a new country that says "We 
give you these rights and the power to totally eliminate them."
