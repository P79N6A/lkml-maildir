I leave it in there mainly for two reasons,
first, for several drivers, it lets people know the base version upon
which the driver was based.  This is useful if someone wanted to do some
merging of a more recent Becker version, and
second, as a courtesy, since typically the code in the driver is still
well over 60% Becker's even after all the Linus-tree modifications.
