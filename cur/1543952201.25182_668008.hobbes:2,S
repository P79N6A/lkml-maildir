But their RAM does not depend on a lot of factors to remain valid and
usable, which is the problem with the common PC.

Securing every component simply reduces the risk of a loss of service.
What is important with data is to know the consequences of loss of service.
If that only means that no one can work and that the last second of work is
lost, it's generally acceptable. If it means everything is lost to a corrupted
FS, obviously it's not.

No, you're replacing disk activity with RAM activity. But you keep disk as
a backend, long-term storage.

Sorry if I was not clear. I was not speaking about replacing the RAM with
flash, but only the disks. You keep the RAM for the speed, and use flash
for permanent storage instead of disks. No seek time, average RW speed now
slightly better than disks, that combined with your ramdisk and ordered
write-backs writes will have the best of both worlds : RAM speed and flash
reliability.
