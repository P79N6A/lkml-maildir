I have tried to track down what is happening here.
The culprint is:
config SUSPEND_SMP
	bool
	depends on SUSPEND_SMP_POSSIBLE && PM_SLEEP
	select HOTPLUG_CPU
	default y
It seems that due to the fact that SUSPEND_SMP is default y
then kconfig enforce the "select HOTPLUG_CPU".
And this happens despite the fact that PM_SLEEP is 'n'
(but SUSPEND_SMP_POSSIBLE is 'y').
It is somewhere in sym_calc_value() or one of the childs that
suddenly causes the change.
But I find it hard to follow this part of the logic in kconfig.
Roman - can you help here with what is going on?
