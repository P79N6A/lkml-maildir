On the subject of -mm: are you going to keep doing the BK imports to
that for the time being, or would it be better to leave the BK trees
alone now and send you individual patches.
For that matter, will there be a brief amnesty after 2.6.12 where Linus
will use BK to pull those trees which were waiting for that, or will we
all need to export from BK manually?
