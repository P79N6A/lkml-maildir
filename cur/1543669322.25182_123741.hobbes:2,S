Rusty, this is amazingly disingenuous.
Never did I say SET_MODULE_OWNER was only for struct net_device.
I even pointed out specifically that it IS NOT tied to a specific structure:

Why don't you just let the maintainers apply the driver "cleanups" if 
they wish, or do not wish, like DaveM did.  Only when that is 
accomplished is it reasonable to consider moving SET_MODULE_OWNER -- and 
only then if other people do not need it's obvious utility.
I would personally rather the macro lived on as a part of the module 
API.  Think of it as part of maintaining friendly hardware vendor 
relations, perhaps?
