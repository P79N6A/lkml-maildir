Hmm?  I thought the periodic timer and one-shot timer both generate the 
same VIRQ.  So, how can you mask one without masking the other?
The tickless idle works since the block hypercall disables the periodic 
timer.  But for dynticks (aka NO_HZ), you'll need to mask the periodic 
timer (even for a running vcpu), while keeping the one-shot timer 
unmasked.  I don't think Xen provides an interface to do that.
