Subject: Panic when finishing raidreconf on 2.4.0-test4 with preempt

I've done this twice now, I'd prefer not to do it again, but can upon
request, if you really need the oops output.
Running raidreconf to expand a 4 disk array to 5, seems to work
correctly until the very end.  I'm guessing it is as the RAID super
block is being written.  A preempt error is triggered and the kernel
panics.  Upon reboot the MD driver doesn't think the 5th disk is valid
for consideration in the array and skips over it.  Leaving a very
corrupted file system.
