After many, many kernel rebuilds for hardware additions
and replacements.  Usually on the same kernel version.
An idea forced its way into my preoccupied mind.
Why not build all the modules whether I need them or
not?  Then if I need a module in the future it is
waiting under /lib/modules.
So I am asking if a:
make all_modules
directive exists or should be added.
Anyone with the disk space might find this
convenient.  Then you could make all_modules &
make modules_install before building your kernel.
If such exists it should be mentioned in the README.
Thank you for the good software,
rob                     Live the dream.
