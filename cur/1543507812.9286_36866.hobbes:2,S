Let it continue... tools that parse kernel information deserve a proper
interface and should not have to parse the information out of strings.
There is sysctl, and parts of it could just be declared "reasonably
stable".  Things could be a lot cleaner that way.
/proc is still a useful idea, especially for new features for which
there are no corresponding utilities yet (although, as a purist, I'd
rather do without this bit of kernel bloat... ;)
