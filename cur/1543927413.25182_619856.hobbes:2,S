Well, for my dualCore notebook, dualCore MythTV box, and QuadCore desktop,
the behaviour of the existing, working, 32-bit kernel IRQBALANCE code
outperforms the userspace utility.
Mostly, I suspect, due to it's much faster response to changing conditions.
That's something the external one could try to match, but at present it
seems tuned specifically for high-traffic network servers, not for the
average notebook or desktop.
Cheers
