Ugh.
->poll must never change any state. The kernel is free to call poll
multiple times (common are once, twice and three times).
Can you use a per-filp pollmask?
* remove poll_active
* remove poll_mask
* add event counters for every possible event.
    poll_count_POLLIN, poll_count_POLLOUT, etc.
* interrupt handler increases the counter.
* ioctl() copies the value of the counters into
    filp->private_data->event_handled_POLL{IN,OUT}
* poll sets the pollmask if
    filp->private_data->event_seen != info->poll_count
If filps (file descriptors) are shared between apps, then I have no
idea how to fix your design.
