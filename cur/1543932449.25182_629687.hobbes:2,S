Subject: [PATCH 2/4] unionfs: 32-bit needs lock for i_size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

LTP's iogen01 doio tests hang nicely on 32-bit SMP when /tmp is a unionfs
mount of a tmpfs.  See the comment on i_size_write in linux/fs.h: it needs
to be locked, otherwise i_size_read can spin forever waiting for a lost
seqcount update.
Most filesystems are already holding i_mutex for this, but unionfs calls
fsstack_copy_inode_size from many places, not necessarily holding i_mutex.
Use the low-level i_lock within fsstack_copy_inode_size when 32-bit SMP.

This works for me, to help get through LTP, but is not enough: what about
those places which use i_size_write in common code called by unionfs?
They ought to participate in this i_locking too.  Needs an audit to
enumerate such places and decide what course to take.
Bigger question: is unionfs calling down to filesystems without holding
their i_mutex, where some may be relying on their i_mutex to be held?
