Erm...  "Gives rejects" => "ought to investigate" => "bugger it, let

OK.  Please, pick the following patches:
UM0-uml-ldscript-RC12-rc3
UM1-uml-os-RC12-rc3
UM2-uml-user-constants-RC12-rc3
UM3-uml-ptregs-RC12-rc3
UM4-uml-sc-RC12-rc3
UM5-uml-kernel-offsets-RC12-rc3
UM6-uml-thread-RC12-rc3
UM7-uml-util-RC12-rc3
UM8-uml-clean-RC12-rc3
UM10-uml-O-RC12-rc3
in ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/people/viro.  In the order above.  That's where
the beginning of Jeff's series had come from (his 1--9 and 4.5).
(In case if you wonder about UM9, that one already has an equivalent in
-mm).
