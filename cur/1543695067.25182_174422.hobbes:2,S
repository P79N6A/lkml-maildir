I hope you didn't circumvent any digital information rights management
schemes?  ;-) No, my fault. Private communication is very un-open-source!
I wrote without access to sources (only some recent patches available) in
a very noisy office and was afraid my post would be as clear as a long quote
from Ulysses.

Ok! As the compiler seems to be at the edge of overasking its capabilities
(three *different* simplifications which each should normally haven't made
any difference *did* make it compile for different people with gcc 2.96)
it might not be a bad idea to apply both simplifications (the 'volatile'
solution I think is not proper C here).

Well it is standard to RedHat 7! If a slight simplification makes it
work again whats wrong with that, as long as its proper C?
Ok, so we have something like this:
Simplify a longish expression so that gcc 2.96 doesn't choke on it.
