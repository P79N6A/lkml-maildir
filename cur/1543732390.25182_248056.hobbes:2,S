It introduces additional bus-atomic operations into the fastpath, so we'll
be slower in the one-process-doing-lots-of ioctls case, and faster in the
lots-of-cpus-doing-ioctls case.
The change certainly makes sense from a clean-things-up and
prepare-for-bkl-removal point of view, however.
Some single-threaded and multi-threaded SMP microbenchmarking would be
nice, if you have time.
