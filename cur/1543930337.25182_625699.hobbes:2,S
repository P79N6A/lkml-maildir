I confess to not really trying hard to understand everything in this thread,
but the implication seems to be that this bug might affect udelay()
and possibly jiffies ?
If so, then fixing it has to be a *must* for 2.6.24, as otherwise we'll get
all sorts of one-in-while odd driver bugs.. like maybe these two for starters:
[Bug 9492] 2.6.24:  false double-clicks from USB mouse
[Bug 9489] 20000+ wake-ups/second in 2.6.24
Neither of which happens often enough to explain or debug,
but either of which *could* be caused by some weird jiffies thing maybe.
