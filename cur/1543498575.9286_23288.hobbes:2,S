> But this is the future, along with how to specify white spaces;
From fstab(5):
       The second field, (fs_file), describes the mount point for
       the filesystem.  For swap partitions, this field should be
       specified as ``none''. If the name of the mount point con-
       tains spaces these can be escaped as `\040'.

The maintainer is aeb@cwi.nl (that's me). Whether I am real I'll leave
to others to decide.
