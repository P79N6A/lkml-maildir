I don't have any insight on the problem, but I can offer anecdotal
evidence on my T41.  Using the default kernel methods for suspend and
hibernate ( echo -n (mem|disk) > /sys/power/state ), it sleeps and
wakes up as expected.  More recently, I'm using the pm-utils suite for
this, and it too works as expected.
This is on Slackware -current (development version) with 2.6.27.7
kernel. I now employ xfce4-power-manager for suspend functionality, but
prior to that, I was using this:

 if
you'd like to peruse it.
