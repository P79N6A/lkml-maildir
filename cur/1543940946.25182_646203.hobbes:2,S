Sure.
How about something like:
Under normal circumstances each device is given a part of the total
write-back cache that relates to its current avg writeout speed in
relation to the other devices.
min_ratio - allows one to assign a minimum portion of the write-back
cache to a particular device. This is useful in situations where you
might want to provide a minimum QoS. (One request for this feature came
from flash based storage people who wanted to avoid writing out at all
costs - they of course needed some pdflush hacks as well)
max_ratio - allows one to assign a maximum portion of the dirty limit to
a particular device. This is useful in situations where you want to
avoid one device taking all or most of the write-back cache. Eg. an NFS
mount that is prone to get stuck, or a FUSE mount which you don't trust
to play fair.
