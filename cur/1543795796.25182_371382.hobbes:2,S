Yeah, mine works like that too - but sometimes it will go left->right  
when you moved the finger
right->left and vice versa.

Nope, if yours works with 80 bytes, it only sends 80. It will still  
work with anything > 80 but that's superfluous data.
(E,g, Mine works even with 1024 - anything above 256 seems junk, but  
with < 256 it dies with EOVERFLOW )
Right now I have detected that byte # 13 increases when moving finger  
along the bottom from left corner to right,
and byte #11 changes when moved from bottom left corner to top left.  
Gotta figure out the rest of the movement patterns
along with how many total sensors X and Y are there and how to relate  
the data to something to report to the input device!
Hopefully Johannes will have a PowerBook with either of the 0x0214 or  
0x0215 touchpads
and we will make some headway!
