The header stuff can only *reduce* capabilities, other mechanisms such as
suid-root or vfs cap support would be needed to raise caps.
I don't think anyone would sell them as the *one* *true* answer.

So worst case is they don't voluntarily lose some of the caps they would
have gotten anyway.

Right now setuid-root gives you everything, binary cap headers would allow
you to trim that down.

They are in the kernel just not realy being used right now.
Could you look at my web page to see what is being done to address that
issue?

Why if some restrictions go in the CONTENTS then they can be restricted
across ftp, nfs, or whatever. Enablers would never go in the contents that
I can think we'd agree is absurd.
