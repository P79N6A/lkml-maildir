Thank you for that advice, the system has 4GB and if I boot with mem=3072M 
it will run as fast as normal while if I don't use the mem option it will 
run 10 times slower, however if I use a figure like mem=3500M the kernel 
will panic, is there any way to determine the highest usable figure 
without try and error?
