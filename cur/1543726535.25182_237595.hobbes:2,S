I think iozone -a or one of the sysbench tests triggers this one.  But
it also happened a few times overnight.  I will try to reproduce it
today.  You are referring to wli's 'preempt timing' patch, correct?
Also, I sent another report of XRUNS related to msync().  I have
narrowed this down a bit.  This one happens whenever 'apt-get update'
replaces its package lists.  Presumably it mmaps the files in
/var/lib/apt/lists and then calls msync at the end to write them out,
which triggers the XRUN.
Here are the results of 'echo m > /proc/sysrq-trigger':
