You could always do:
	while(whatever)
        {
             set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
             schedule_timeout(0);
             if(signal_pending(current))
                 break;        // Or do something else
        }
        set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING); // Probably redundant
You could also set a specific HZ for the timeout, and count
them for a "never happened" timeout.
Cheers,
