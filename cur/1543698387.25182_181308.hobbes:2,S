Hi:
I am currently using Slackware 9.1 with a custom built
kernel (2.4.22).  The problem I am having is that
sometimes (not always), I can mount my USB memory
stick.  It happens very infrequently.  When I insert,
the hotplug support detects it and loads usb-storage
and starts two processes (usb-storage-0 and
scsi_eh_1).  Most (99%) of the time, the mount program
freezes when attempting to mount the device, and can
only be stopped by waiting and sending kill -9. 
Thereafter, the device (/dev/sda1) states that it is
not a valid black device AND the USB port I tried to
use becomes unusable until a restart.  Further, the
two processes I described earlier are impossible to
kill.
Any ideas?  I am currently in the process of upgrading
to the newest kernel (2.4.23).  An additional note is
that the ehci-hcd (usb2) module is loaded and I am
trying to use it for the higher transfer rates.
Thanks
Mike
