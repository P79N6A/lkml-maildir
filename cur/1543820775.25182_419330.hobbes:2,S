Could just be the use of spin lock instead of read lock.
I don't think it would be hard to convert find_get_pages_contig
to be lockless.
Patched vanilla numbers look nicer, but I'm curious as to why
__do_page_cache was so bad before, if the file was in cache.
Presumably it should not more than double tree_lock acquisition...
it isn't getting called multiple times for each page, is it?
