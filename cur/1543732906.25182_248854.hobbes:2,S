Actually this "attack" is avoided, because restrictions are enherited, 
from parent proces to its children.
Okay, this is how it works in basic:
------------------
ks@qbox:~/umbrella-devel/userspace
$ touch /tmp/a
ks@qbox:~/umbrella-devel/userspace
$ ./umbrella_restricted_sh
sh-2.05b$ touch /tmp/a
touch: setting times of `/tmp/a': Operation not permitted
sh-2.05b$ exit
Restricted child died
Thank you for testing!

- the "umbrella_restricted_sh" just forks a new shell, which is 
restricted from /tmp
Now let's try your suggestion:
------------------------
root@qbox:~/umbrella-devel/userspace
$ id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) 
groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel),11(floppy),20(dialout),26(tape),27(video)
root@qbox:~/umbrella-devel/userspace
$ mkdir new-tmp
root@qbox:~/umbrella-devel/userspace
$ mount --bind /tmp new-tmp
root@qbox:~/umbrella-devel/userspace
$ mount
/dev/discs/disc1/part2 on / type ext3 (rw)
none on /dev type devfs (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
none on /sys type sysfs (rw)
none on /dev/pts type devpts (rw)
/dev/discs/disc0/part1 on /home type ext3 (rw)
/dev/discs/disc0/part2 on /media type ext3 (rw)
none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
none on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
/tmp on /home/ks/umbrella-devel/userspace/new-tmp type none (rw,bind)
root@qbox:~/umbrella-devel/userspace
$ ./umbrella_restricted_sh
sh-2.05b# touch /tmp/a
touch: setting times of `/tmp/a': Operation not permitted
sh-2.05b# touch new-tmp/a
touch: setting times of `new-tmp/a': Operation not permitted
sh-2.05b# ls new-tmp/
ls: new-tmp/: Operation not permitted
sh-2.05b# exit
Restricted child died
Thank you for testing!

As you can see, the bind-mount fails to succeed in accessing the files 
in /tmp.
Best regards, Kristian.
