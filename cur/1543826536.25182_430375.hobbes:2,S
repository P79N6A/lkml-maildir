Sorry for the delay.  I've had a long weekend.

As Paul already pointed, the platform_device things must be fixed.
Also, better to clean up the code directly accessing hardcoded
addresses.
Another big concern is that spu_dma_work is initialized/rewritten
dynamically in spu_begin_dma() and aica_period_elapsed() via
INIT_WORK() and PREPARE_WOR().  This looks pretty strange and may be
racy.
