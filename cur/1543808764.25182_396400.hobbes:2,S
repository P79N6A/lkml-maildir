I don't think anybody claimed this isn't a regression for the 600X.
Sanjoy has done a wonderful job documenting that.
My point is that it that on the grand scale of bugs serious enough
to have an effect on the course of 2.6.16, this one doesn't qualify
unless the same issue is seen on other systems.
