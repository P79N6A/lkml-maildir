Oops. Seems that there was one. Looks like I did not check the system well
enough after rh70 install...

Ok, good. So avoiding ejecting cdrom without unmounting first will save me
from further oopses.

Yes. The other problem I saw with 2.2.18pre vm wasn't an oops, it was a
rampaging vm rambo that slaughtered my X while it was idle. Admittedly
that is not as severe as oops, so the vm situation is not as bad as I
thought.

No problem.
