Some of them are internal, but some are not, they just happened to be
privileged CPU operations available to anyone.
Does anyone know what hooks they are actually using?  Something like
reading MSRs is not internal at all, it is CPU specific, and the
graphics drivers might have very good reasons to read them to figure out
how AGP is configured for example.
The graphics drivers most certainly don't need to be paravirtualized
however, so they could always work around this with raw asm constructs.
The mmu_ops hook is more debatable.  But until someone figures out what
hooks they want, we can't know whether they are internal or not.  In any
case, this is a regression.
