Yes, I guess that's what Alan must have meant.
This atomic_cmpxchg, unlike a "regular" cmpxchg, has the advantage
that the memory altered should always be going through the atomic_
accessors, and thus should be implementable with spinlocks.
See for example, arch/sparc/lib/atomic32.c
At least, that's what I'm hoping for.

Yes, and indeed it does. However it also tests for "cpu_has_llsc",
but I suspect that SMP isn't supported on those CPUs without ll/sc,
and thus an atomic_cmpxchg could be emulated by disabling interrupts.
