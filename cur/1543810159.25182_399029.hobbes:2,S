in the same way as for resources or filesystems -
management is within the parent, usage within the
child

for resources it's simple, you have to 'give away'
a certain share to your children, which in turn will
enable them to utilize them up to the given amount,
or (depending on the implementation) up to the total
amount of the parent.
(check out ckrm as a proof of concept, and example
how it should not be done :)

there are many use cases here, first, the VPS within
a VPS (of course, not the most useful one, but the
most obvious one), then there are all kind of test,
build and security scenarios which can benefit from
hierarchical structures and 'delegated' administrative
power (just think web space management)

well, we already visited the following:
 - filesystem namespaces (works quite fine completely
   independant of all other)
 - pid spaces (again they are quite fine without any
   other namespace)
 - resource spaces (another one which makes perfect
   sense to have without the others)
the fact that some things like proc or netlink is tied
to networking and ipc IMHO is just a sign that those
interfaces need revisiting and proper isolation or
virtualization ...

well, the lifetime of such a space is very likely to
be at least the time of the users, including all
created sockets, file-handles, ipc resources, etc ...

not directly, well, you 'could' make some kind of
crawler which goes and kills off all structures
keeping a reference to that particular namespace

yup, that's how it could/should work ...

yes, those have to be adressed and a very specific
semantic has to be found, so that no surprises happen

well, I was not the one rolling out the 'perfect'
vpid solution ...

Linux-VServer does not have any of those syscalls
and it works quite well, so why should we need such
syscalls?
note: I do not consider clone() or unshare() to be
of this category (just to avoid confusion)

I have no problem at all to discuss a general plan
(hey I though we were already doing so :) or move
to some other area (like networking :)
