Thanks. Your patch fixed the cardbus hotplug issue perfectly on my laptop.
It survives multiple insert/eject cycles without any problems.
The patch posted by Yaacov Akiba Slama today also fixed cardbus hotplug
for me, but with his patch the kernel still prints "PCI: No IRQ known for
interrupt pin A of device xx:xx.x. Please try using pci=biosirq" when the
cardbus NIC is inserted; Jens Taprogge's patch silenced that warning.
