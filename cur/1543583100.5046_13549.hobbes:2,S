Andries,
okay, your arguments appear correct to me. Additionally there has some
other work
to be done... I include the patch to be applied from my point of view:
(See attached file: ibmpart.diff)
It includes the adaptions to the dasd_*.c files in drivers/s390/block and
also should
fix the fill_geometry functions to make HDIO_GETGEO work like others.
Gruesse / Regards
