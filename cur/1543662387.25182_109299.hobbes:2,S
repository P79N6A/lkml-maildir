If CPU_FREQ_TABLE itself depends on CPU_FREQ, then X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ 
automatically depends on CPU_FREQ too, so you can remove CPU_FREQ from the 
dependency list.
You can also put X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ and all following options, which depend 
on CPU_FREQ_TABLE, within an "if CPU_FREQ_TABLE" ... "endif" block.
bye, Roman
