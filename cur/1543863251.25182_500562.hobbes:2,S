Hi Arjan,
I won't pretend I'm working on an open-source driver. I personally
would be more than happy to share the driver code, but doing so would
probably cost me my job :)
and so...I won't expect anyone to help me with my code either.
Just wanted to know if wake_up is known to take this long to return?
(some known linux quirk may be?) If so then under what conditions? or
it _definitely_ would be my code only that's screwing up?
I'm using do_gettimeofday() before and after wake_up() to measure this time.
Thanks and regards,
-Kalash
