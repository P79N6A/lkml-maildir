Status update.
I removed the nvida driver module (thus making it, contrary to what I
  had considered vanilla) *truly* vanilla.  [Sorry about that; I really
  didn't mean to mislead.]
Upon reboot, the cs4236B "card" works 100% (although, for some reason, the
  xmms alsa drivers can't talk to it directly, but that's survivable;
  I'm using esd right now anyway; it's likely a debian problem or a
  Joe Confusigration problem).
My compliments and gratitude to all those who helped; I have now moved
  my workstation to 2.6.  I'll buy a student copy of SuSE when my laptop
  gets here next week.  ;)
