Thanks.  I'm not trolling.  Perhaps I was a bit snarky; it's an issue I
feel strongly about.  (I'm sure others feel just as strongly, but
differently.)

Agreed.

Let's consider a totally original USB driver.  There are an infinite
number of them, some still to be written.

Have I the wrong end of the stick?  Isn't that mark restricting an
interface to GPL _callers_?    Isn't it a technical switch that means,
"Don't use my software if yours isn't (also) GPL"?  As such it's mere
political rhetoric, devoid of any binding power.

I agree; but let's not disadvantage applications where regulatory
requirements prohibit GPL code, nor applications where the proprietor
simply chooses to keep the work proprietary.  A proprietary module is
simply a piece of software.  Many people couldn't use Linux if they
couldn't run proprietary software on it.

That's defeatist.  Of course the Linux kernel can properly support
("run") proprietary code.  It would be a miserable excuse for an
operating system if it couldn't.
