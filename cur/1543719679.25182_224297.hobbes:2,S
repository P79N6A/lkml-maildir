No, it does not help in this case.
Not putting things in cache is a solution for the problem of
having useful stuff pushed out of the cache.  However, fixing
the problem this way may create other problems if it causes
us to fail to put useful things into the cache.
The point I was trying (perhaps unsuccessfully) to make, is
that we should be careful about not caching things.  We are
likely to break other corner cases by fixing the ones we
are discussing.
Thanks,
Jim
