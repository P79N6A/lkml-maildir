You need to do more than just add an iovec argument to
nfs_file_direct_read()/nfs_file_direct_write() if you want to achieve
this. The new call interface actually just clarifies something that was
implicit in the old one.
As I said in my other posting, I believe Chuck's changes are relatively
orthogonal to what you want to do: they neither make the low-level
plumbing better or worse for readv()/writev().
We'd be happy to work with you in the run-up to 2.6.18 to add
multi-segment support for the existing patchsets. It makes more sense to
me to append that functionality to the existing patchsets rather than
trigger a complete rewrite (and thus have a sh_tload more code to
retest).
Cheers,
