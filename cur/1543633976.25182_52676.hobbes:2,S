You can do whatever you want, as long as...
1. you have cache control instructions and use them
2. the bridge ignores the coherency protocol (no machine check)
Most likely you should make the AGP memory write-back
cacheable. This requires some care regarding cache lines,
but ought to be faster.

For non-x86 one must "hack up all of memory management" anyway.
Example: There aren't any MTRRs on the PowerPC, but every page
has 4 memory type bits. It's not OK to map something more than
one way at the same time. Large "pages" (256 MB each) are used
to cover all of non-highmem physical memory.
