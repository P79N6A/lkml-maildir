Did you hit an oops because of this?

... because if not, and new_last_stage will never be NULL at all in this
function, the check here could be removed instead of adding another one.
Or perhaps a BUG_ON(!stage) in idetape_end_request() already?
Bartlomiej, please have a look at the following patch.  Should all of
these hand-checks in the file be replaced by BUG_ON()s?  Or be removed
completely?

Turn possible NULL-pointer dereference in idetape_active_next_stage()
into an explicit bug and remove the warn-only checking for it.

The explicit checking of @stage indicates that someone was expecting
that it could be NULL here.  Could someone with real understanding of
the code check if the condition is realistic?
