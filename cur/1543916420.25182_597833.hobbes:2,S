Yeah, I was wondering that too, but it does seem to be needed.  If I
make it a noop, and run the pinned tasks with an unpinned make -j2 test,
Xorg at nice -5 still takes hits...

...which begs the question "gee, what happens if I pin a nice 0 hog to
CPU0, and a nice 19 hog to CPU1 with the queues never ever syncing?".
The answer to that one seems to be "Don't even think about it!".  This
needs more investigation... there's gotta be a 32 bit thingie hiding in
there.  I lost control for a few seconds, got it back, then lost it
again forever (sysrq-b worked though, hmm).
