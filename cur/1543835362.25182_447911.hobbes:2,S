I think what people want from device choice is a reasonable default
plus a convenient way to override things. The former is handled nicely
by distributions' udev rules, while the latter is best done by
providing fixed paths. As an end-user, if I know my favorite joystick
is on a specific USB port (hence a specific syfs directory), then I
want to tell neverball "use that one" without setting up nasty udev
rules or playing major:minor matchup. Yes, that's bypassing the Proper
Udevian Way of Doing Things, but it's so much easier and Unix-like
that we really should make it possible (though not by default!).
Security issues aside (for a moment):
Is there any reason not to provide real device inodes on sysfs,
instead of just a textual /sys/foo/dev? And then, maybe udev should
symlink to those device files under /sys instead of creating its own?
This would tie the two systems together rather elegantly.

I think there's a lot more to *that* flamewar - such as unwavering
belief in generic scsi...

Yes, I understand. I just pointed out that in the specific case of
system accelerometer readouts, either the readouts change very slowly
or your laptop is being rattled into an early death.

Exactly.
