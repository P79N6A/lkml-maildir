    i was wondering if anyone had seen this error when employing the BusLogic
    BT-958 PCI SCSI using driver version 2.0.14, the disk is an IBM Ultra Star
    18XP ( non-SCA ), and the kernel is 2.0.35.
    the error text is:
    17:37:08 master kernel: SCSI disk error : host 0 channel 0 id 6 lun 0 return code = 28000002 
    17:37:08 master kernel: extra data not valid Current error sd08:10: sense key Hardware Error 
    17:37:08 master kernel: Additional sense indicates Internal target failure 
    17:37:08 master kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 2, absolute sector 2
  
  The Hardware Error / Internal Target Failure is a report from the disk drive
  itself, so I would think this has to be an issue with the drive, not the host
  adapter.  I suggest you inquire of IBM what this might mean.

i keep getting these messages as well on an IBM DGHS 9GB-UW
Ultrastrar attached to a BusLogic BT-958W. It's always the exact same
return code as above, and nearly always on the same sector, sector
16.
is it a bad sector or a problem with the drive? 
hibernia kernel: SCSI disk error : host 0 channel 0 id 0 lun 0
return code = 28000002
hibernia kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:01, sector 16
(noticed from IBM's page that they don't swap disks under warranty 
for end-users, only for distributors - damm!)
