	Too bad he didn't finish the job.  I've got a device driver in
there (Computone) which is listed in devices.txt but is NOT handled by
devfsd.  So we have to add the links by hand or modify /etc/devfsd.conf
(I'm just figuring out the entries to do that now).  I haven't decided
whether to add a /etc/devfsd.computone file and add an include to the
main configuration file or try to add all the entries directly in.  Sigh...
