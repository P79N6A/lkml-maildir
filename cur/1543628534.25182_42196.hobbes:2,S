Now that I am working on the configurable maximum RT value patch, I see
why I did this: we can't hardcode the values like "0 to 99" because that
99 is set now via a compile-time define.  Even if it defaults to 100, it
can be a range of values so the comments should be specific and give the
exact define.
That is why I did it in the invariant patch, anyhow - and I think it
makes the most sense to do it in this patch.
