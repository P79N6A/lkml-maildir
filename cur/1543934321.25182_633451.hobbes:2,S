I think there is another reason; now we have disable_all_kprobes() which
disarms(removes BREAKPOINT instruction) all kprobes. So, this should be commented.
By the way, IMHO, if a debugger causes it, that might be a bug.
Since when the debugger removes a breakpoint, it should prevent the exception
caused by the breakpoint on other processors. In other words, the debugger
should work as transparently as possible.

I think whole of this case might have a bug. Since "p" is a recursing kprobe on
the instruction buffer of the running kprobe, *p->ainsn.insn is the next singlestep
target. I think KPROBE_HIT_SS should be treated as same as KPROBE_HIT_ACTIVE.
If the author thought a situation that a user inserts a kprobe on a breakpoint which
has been set by other debugger, we have to check it in !p case, because
get_kprobe(running_kprobe->ainsn.insn) will return NULL in that case.

Originally, if (kcb->kprobe_status==KPROBE_HIT_SS) && !(*p->ainsn.insn == BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTION),
it increments nmissed_count and change the status to KPROBE_REENTER. Please trace the flow carefully.
