You mean both of their kernel pieces are modular?  That's correct.

I don't think so ... if you actually look at the code, you'll see it
doesn't really have persistent state for the enclosure.

But it does matter if the enclosure device doesn't speak SCSI.  SGPIO
isn't a SCSI protocol ... it's a general purpose serial bus protocol.
It's pretty simple and register based, but it might (or might not) be
accessible via a SCSI bridge.

Yes, it provides a glue between the enclosure services and the SES
protocol.

That's possible, but none of these layers exist yet ... although I think
(assuming I can find a SGPIO enclosure) that SGPIO might be next.

At the moment it looks to be SES, SGPIO and AHCI.

So your idea is to provide a separate interface per enclosure in kernel?
Sure ... like I said patches welcome.  I just did a common in-kernel
interface that abstracts common enclosure services.
