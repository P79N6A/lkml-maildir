Yes, certainly that would do it.. as would the situation if the binary is
written in such a way so that before breaking the buffer and setting up a
return into the <16MB address space, somehow you had enough control to set
up the stack frame so that it contains a pointer and the string "/bin/sh"
after the return address.  Maybe by exploiting some local parameter
variable to the function you are in??
I don't know.. but at this point it gets really really unlikely that this
situation would exist, and you are right in saying that the more layers of
protection and the more improbable you make things for the cracker, the
better off you are.
Clearly without the ASCII-shield and exec-limit, it is pretty much
guaranteed that every unchecked buffer on the stack that accepts ASCII
data is crackable, whereas with the ASCII-shield + exec limit, the
guarantee still doesn't exist...

What is prelink -R?
