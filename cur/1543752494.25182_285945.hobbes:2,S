Hi!
I just noticed that my original patch says "ioctl_compat" all over the place
while the actual field name in -mm2 is "compat_ioctl". Doh.
Here's a replacement patch.
PS. Please dont flame me, I do not maintain out of kernel modules, myself :)
To make life bearable for out-of kernel modules, the following patch
adds 2 macros so that existance of unlocked_ioctl and compat_ioctl
can be easily detected.
