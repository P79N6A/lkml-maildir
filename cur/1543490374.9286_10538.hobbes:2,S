No, there was a project a long time ago if I remember right, but as far
as I know it went nowhere.
Cachefs would be really great, however.  It's one thing thats keeping some
people stuck to Solaris and IRIX right now.  I can say from experience that
it is extremely useful.

What you want is "unionfs" from BSD4.4.  It's a seperate problem (although
it could be used with cachefs as you explain)  Unfortunately, this isn't
something linux has either.  I think the new VFS stuff would make this
not too hard.  Some people are working on getting something like BSD's
'stackable filesystems' running under linux.

I'd suggest taking up this discussion on linux-future instead.  There are
some people interested in future directions for VFS there.
