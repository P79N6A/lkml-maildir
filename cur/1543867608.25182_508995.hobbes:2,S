Hi people,
arriving to this state. What do you recommend?
I have the box more or less working with irqpoll but with a lot of messages:
APIC error on CPU0: 08(08)
and the box doesn't boot without the irqpoll option. Do you think that the 
2.6.21 have some kind of changes in this area?
Thank's for all for you patience and your messages.
Best regards,
Leo
