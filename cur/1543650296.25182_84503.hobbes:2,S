Hi,
the attached is a patch to create a new driver module,
snd-pc98-cs4232, which supports CS4232 on PC9800 and PC98II MPU
daughterboard.  (if you find the module name weird, please change as
you like.  the name is tentative :)
in this patch, almost all pc98-specific hardware initialization is
done in the card module, hence the changes to common modules become
minimum.
the new module accepts the following module options.
please note that "snd_" prefix for module options (not module name)
is removed from the newest alsa drivers.
port		mandatory
fm_port		optional
mpu_port	optional
mpu_irq		optional
dma1		mandatory
dma2		optional
pc98ii		optional, bool (0 or 1)
the MPU401 type is specified via pc98ii module option, not via the
kernel config, so that the module binary can be shared among different
machines.
since the chip on pc98 seems like non-isapnp, i removed isapnp stuff
from the module.  also, control-port is disabled.
please check whether it works for you.  if it's ok, i'd like to merge
it into alsa cvs, so the changes will be sent as ALSA update patches
later.
thanks,
Takashi
