It's not (to my knowledge) being considered. In NFSv3 and NFSv4 it
really isn't much of an issue anyway, since you can ask the server to
directly set atime/mtime/ctime according to its local
clock. Time-updates will therefore always be correct, and you can
always keep correct time-ordering of files.
If you need anything more than that, you should be looking to using
xntpd or some such protocol.
Cheers,
