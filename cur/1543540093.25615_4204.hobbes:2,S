I am working on a project that requires me to use the 2.3.99pre9 kernel
sources. However, when I boot my AlphaStation 200 (Avanti) with that kernel, I
can't login via the serial console or at the keyboard. I was previously able to
login via the network connection and ssh (and only this way), but now the
network appears not to work with that kernel (no I don't know what has changed).
The question is, if I can login just fine when I boot a 2.2.x kernel, why do all
logins fail with a 2.3.99 kernel? Any ideas would be appreciated.
Config file attached.
