The problem is that my the problem occurs in a program completely
independent from my stressthreads program (it is meant only for
demonstration purposes). This SIGSEGV occurs in our multithreaded proxy
firewall software called Zorp.
We are using a dummy signal handler (not SIG_IGN), and the SIGSEGV still
occurs.
A last addition is that the problem occurs on non-SMP kernels as well,
albeit much more rarely.
My workaround is now not to use syslog() from libc. I implemented my own
syslog writing routines, and the problem didn't occur (though it's been
running for two days now, so nothing is for sure yet).
For the time being I'm also trying to reproduce the problem without
syslog() as I think it is a kernel related problem.
I think it must be related to the fact syslog() is changing signal handler
routines very often.
thanks for the feedback.
