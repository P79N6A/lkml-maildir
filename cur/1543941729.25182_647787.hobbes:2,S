Hello,
I have  a asus a6t with nforce4/MCP51 chipset. I pass to kernel 2.6.24 
32 bit the options acpi_use_timer_override and hpet=force, in this way 
and the timer IRQ ends up routed as  IO-APIC-edge instead of XT-PIC. 
With acpi_use_timer_override I just get:
TIMER: vector=0x30 apic1=0 pin1=2 apic2=-1 pin2=-1
and it works through the IO-APIC. 
Instead the hpet is disabled and I  just get :
Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = -85010975 ns)
Is possible to have hpet working also with if the BIOS doesn't support 
it ?
I wish to be personally CC'ed the answers/comments posted to the list 
in response to my posting.
Cecco
