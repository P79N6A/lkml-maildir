What did we do....
First we added two things for the Promise owners.
If you have a FastTrak and you wish to use it in normal mode, we have a
solution now.  Place all the drives in "span" with only one drive per
array.  This makes each array a single device.  This will work; however,
you must set the new Promise Option to enable the HOST regardless.
Do not set this option with Promise's I2O card!
CSB5...erm it is a work in progress but should be fully functional in
24-48 hours.
AMD761 is fully functional upto ATA-66, the ATA-100 feature is not
complete, but will register so...if you board works great, otherwise issue
an hdparm -X68 /dev/hdX to set the HOST into ATA-66 mode.
The dreaded timeout is actively being killed.
The mystery of hot-swap, well see LANANA thread....since there is a freeze
on char-major-10-XXX device points, thus there is a freeeze on this code
coming to Linux. :-(
I hope to have all of this cleaned up and ready for submission for the
pre3/4/5 patch releases.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
