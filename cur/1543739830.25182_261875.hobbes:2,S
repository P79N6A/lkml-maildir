Most BIOS'es are relatively good, but there are some terrible ones. We 
have one a lot of work over the years making our VESA VBE drivers work 
well with all the BIOS'es out there, working around the issues in the 
broken ones. I plan to use that same module for the kernel VESA driver 
when I get around to re-writing it.

Yep.

Right now the compiled x86 code is about 100K in size. PowerPC code 
appears to be about twice that size and x86-64 is about 130K I think. I 
have no idea how big an Open Firmware interpreter would be for comparison 
purposes because I have never seen an Open Source implementation of one.
