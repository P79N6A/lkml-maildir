I don't think "tar" is anything more than an enabler here - it's just that on
my laptop it's one of the more abusive things I can do to the file system (especially
when source and dest directories are on the same file system).  I've had the problem
pop up while reading down my e-mail, which is another "lots of little files" scenario
(500+ lines of procmailrc, passing stuff to/from spamassassin, and storing in the
MH "one message per file" format)....
I'm about to start building -rc2-mm1 - I'm probably going to liberally sprinkle some
strategic printk's so we have a chance of flushing out why it's failing...
