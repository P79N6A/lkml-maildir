Are you implying some kind of ->telldir() file operation that notifies
file-system that user has intention to later restart readdir from the
"current" position and changing glibc to call sys_telldir/sys_seekdir in
stead of lseek? This will allow file-systems like reiser4 that cannot
restart readdir from 32bitsful of data to, at least, allocate something
in kernel on call to ->telldir() and free in ->release().
