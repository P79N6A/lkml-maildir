The IP id generation fix looks fine. The rest of it looks like sheer lunacy.
The IP sequence number is a mere 16bits. The worst you can do by predicting
it is to cause the odd packet to be lost. There is no real world evidence
tht throwing that giant pile of code, and huge AVL tree into the kernel 
improves or fixes any kind of real world security issue. It adds some nice
performance harming features to the kernel in the process.
