Yes, I'm on this list.
No, I don't see all patches or comments unless they get sent directly
to: or cc: to me.

I disagree with this decision, and would like to know what
is necessary to reverse it.

If it is a requirement that I see every patch sent to the list
and not directly to me during weekends in July, then I agree
with your decision -- because I can't give you that level of service.
But surely:
1. You can e-mail me directly when you are asking me to do something.
2. deleting the driver is a somewhat Draconian response to what appears
 to be a simple Kconfig issue in rc1.

The memhotplug patches first hit the list March 21st -- the 1st day of
the 2.6.17 integration window.
I would have queued them for 2.6.18-rc1, but they depended
on other patches in -mm that Andrew did not send me.
Yes, I Should have mentioned that to Andrew, and acked
the patches so he could have sorted that out.
However, the only way they could have got into 2.6.18-rc1 any
earlier would be if the 2.6.17 cycle were shorter.

If you address me directly when you are asking me to do something,
that would really help me help you.
thanks,
