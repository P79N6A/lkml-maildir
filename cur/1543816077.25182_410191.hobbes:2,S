Agreed.  The current algorithm in the kernel is close to 2Q, 
just without the corrections that 2Q gets from non-resident
history and the further tuning that is done by clock-pro.

Remember that it's not necessarily about "making a VM that
handles the common case better", but rather about "making
the VM behave well more of the time".
Furthermore, all VM benchmarks are corner cases.  After all,
most systems have enough memory most of the time, and will
not be evicting much at all.  This makes interpreting VM
benchmark results harder than the interpretation of many
other benchmarks...
