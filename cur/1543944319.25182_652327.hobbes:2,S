OK, I'll address it then (or try to).  Just don't eat me please ... I'm
only a small and timid storage maintainer ...

I can sort of agree, but I don't think you can say enough == no more API
changes.  There's the request_irq argument removal patch floating around
somewhere for instance ...but as someone said "Every rule always has an
exception".
I think what's really needed is a balance where it's painful (on the
originator) to make an API change.  Part of what -mc or -next trees can
do is to make that pain visible early (and often).

OK, so you can supply the pain as well.

I think this is exaggerated.  By the end of the -rc cycle for 2.6.24 I
had six merge fixup patches because of trivial cross subsystem API
changes and two dropped trees because of intractable problems (and they
were notified and later fixed themselves up).  Given that I was
including about 50 git trees and 4 quilt ones, that's not too bad,
Especially as we had all the API churn you mentioned.

I agree with this too.  When I introduce an API, I usually try to make
sure it will last the test of time ... the trouble is, I'm not always
omniscient.
So the point, I think we've reached is that:
     1. we want to try to enforce good design for APIs to try to ensure
        they're as future proof as foreseeable.
     2. We have to recognise that 1. is impossible in practice and
        provide a mechanism for correcting APIs
So, I think our current system is good in that it enforces pain on
people who change APIs.  However, perhaps we are missing the bit where
we reflect longer before introducing APIs in the first place. (hey,
better reviewing ... I've heard that one before ...)
