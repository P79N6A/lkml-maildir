I use CLONE_KERNEL but in my body I dont't call exit_files and
demonize... I change the linux scheduler width my scheduler and I use
only the switch_to  for context_switch from a task to another... I have
a task descriptor with a pointer to the task_t * ... At this time I have
a linux task_t struct and my personal task struct...
Best regards
Michael
