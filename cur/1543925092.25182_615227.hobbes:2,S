Ew, no. This is horridly broken. You should never use CONFIG_xxx_MODULE
in the static kernel at all -- and you should _especially_ not be using
it in header files which are exported to userspace.
This abomination certainly doesn't seem to have any direct relation to
mn10300 support -- I think all you really need there is not to attempt
to export {asm,linux}/a.out.h if asm/a.out.h doesn't exist, which is
something you haven't attempted here anyway.
