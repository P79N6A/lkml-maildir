I'm not completely sure about burning audio, but linux doesn't read
audio cds using DMA.  It just wont on ide devices.  You can use a patch
that allows this from andrew morton.  I dont write many audio cds so
I've never tested it's effect on writing a cd, only reading.  I imagine
it's not safe to use dma on raw/audio cds.  but go check it out
anyways.
