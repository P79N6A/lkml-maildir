Task wants to do a syscall (i.e. int 0x30 in Fiasco), the kernel process tracing
the task sees the signal in its SIGCHLD handler. It pulls the registers out of the
task's address space using PTRACE_GETREGS and sets up an interrupt frame on the
kernel stack. EIP and ESP in the saved signal context are frobbed in a way that
the signal handler falls right into the correct interrupt gate when it returns.
iret works the other way round. SIGSEGV handler in the kernel process copies registers
back to task and restarts the task's process after restoring kernel state.

As it is now, in order to get at the page fault address one has to invoke a SIGSEGV
handler in the task, then look at the task's signal context to determine the pagefault
address, trapno etc. It would be much faster if the kernel could cancel the SIGSEGV signal
in the task's process and read out the the pagefault info from the TCB via a ptrace
extension. Saves the cost of a running a signal handler in the task and a bunch of context
switches.

Yes, trampoline page is shared between kernel and task. Nevertheless there are
context switches that wouldn't be necessary if the kernel could tweak the task's
mm directly.
