You have access to a part of the sources :(
http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/Intel/
but there is a big "536epcore.lib", 
I don't know if it is workable in a 2.5 kernel ...
I was just trying to compile the source part and it doesn't
because of irq related stuffs at this time.
Maybe I'm too naive, and 
536epcore.lib is a big problem...
Nicolas.
