Subject: [2.6.16-gitX] heavy performance regression in ipw2200 wireless driver

Driver - or firmware ? Don't know - since the new git snapshots run
 1.1.1 which requires newer firmware from 
http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net
.
Symptom -> my new FC5 partition with 2.6.16-git kernels connects via
 VNC viewer to my bittorrent box over wireless (ipw2200 to a D-Link
 G604T router/AP); Dell D610 runs FC5, BT box is a K7-800 running
 FC3 with a 2.6.16-rc5-git8 kernel (15+ days uptime...).
I also run Firefox on the bittorrent box; noticed today (2.6.16-git5) that
 the screen refresh of pages with images was from time to time very
 slow (close to unusable).
Rebooted into my FC4 partition with a 2.6.16 kernel, everything much
 snappier. So I ran a scp test from my BT server to the laptop, three
 times in a row the same file - a 38MB .flac with the laptop in the same
 physical position (ie, no signal variation). Results...
FC5 - 2.6.16-git3:

Bottom line - old driver has better performance than the new one,
 but most noticeably delivers consistent performance.
I will be available for testing starting Thursday 30th as I'll be on
 the road since then. Of course if the problem is identified and
 fixed earlier, I won't cry ;)
Thanks,
