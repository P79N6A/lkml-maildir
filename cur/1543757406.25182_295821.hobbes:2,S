Hi Andrew,
The new "move-accounting-function-calls-out-of-critical-vm-code-paths"
patch in 2.6.11-rc3-mm2 was different from the code i tested.
In particular, it mistakenly dropped the accounting routine calls
in fs/exec.c. The calls in do_execve() are needed to properly
initialize accounting fields. Specifically, the tsk->acct_stimexpd
needs to be initialized to tsk->stime.
I have discussed this with Christoph Lameter and he gave me full
blessings to bring the calls back.
This initialize_acct_integrals patch was generated against
2.6.11-rc3-mm2 to fix the problem. Thanks!
