I was talking about the write(2) performances of only one writer. `cp
/dev/zero /tmp'. Probably they are better but the wait_on_buffer in
flushpage make me not sure of that. Also considering that waiting for I/O
completation for every flushpage means a very high scheduling rate during
writes. I still have to verify in practice these things though.
