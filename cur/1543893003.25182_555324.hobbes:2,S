Just like all other subsystems?
No, the only information the device name is that it shows a UNIQUE name
at that point in time in the kernel.  Heck, we could just use random
numbers that are unique like some other people have suggested, it would
mean the exact same thing.

Wrong, the attributes in that directory mean everything.  The name means
nothing.

Exactly.

Ok, then use a random number please.  Start with 00000000000001 and just
increment from there, or use the idr subsystem.
I was trying to be nice and at least give you a prefix that looked kind
of sane to people, but if you want to be difficult... :)

Because that is not how things work, sorry.

Again, the bus id needs to be unique, for that specific class/bus that's
it.  The attributes in the directory let you figure out what specifics
are for the device.
Look at the PCI and USB devices.  There is some information you can
glean from those names, but they are primary a unique identifier, you
need to look at the attributes to get the real information about your
device.
LED devices are no different.

Great, the more the merrier.  Seriously, I have no problem with that.

If you know the color and location already, why not export that
information?  Unless you can determine it from userspace some other way
already?

If there's no other way for userspace to determine it, then put it in
the kernel.  Otherwise leave it for userspace to handle.

Well, if that is possible.  Just put it in an attribute.

Sorry, I missed it with the other stuff on lkml, but now I'm trying to
get this fixed.  Just use an attribute like the whole rest of the
kernel and a number for a bus id.

Nope.

Yup, and there's no real bloat at all.

bus ids mean almost nothing today, see above.

No, use an attribute please.

I know that LEDs are special and unique, just like everyone else, so
please work like everyone else does :)
