You were probably thinking of CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN above, then.  That causes the kernel to probe all LUNs instead of just LUN 0, which is the default due to a lot of broken devices to respond to all LUNs instead of just LUN 0.  The sparse LUN option is in addition to that in 2.5.x.
If this is for a live server, it might be easiest to hard code the LUNs you need it to probe in to 2.4.x for now, and wait until 2.6.x for proper support.
