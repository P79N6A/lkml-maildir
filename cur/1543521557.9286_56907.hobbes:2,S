Well, I'm pretty sure dhcpd uses stdio and malloc, so it won't save nearly
as much space unless you replace those libraries with something of the
not-glibc variety.

It gets really inefficient really fast to have _lots_ of static binaries on
one disk.  My ideal solution would be something like this:
	- glibc2.1-based basic kernel calls (read, write, socket, etc)
	- Cygnus newlib-based stdio/malloc
	- all apps statically linked and merged into a single binary that
	  keys off argv[0], in the manner of Debian's 'busybox' program.
	- and it all builds automatically :)
I'm probably dreaming, but I've been wanting to do it for quite a while now.
Have fun,
Avery
P.S. I'm not on Linux-kernel, so please leave me in the CC: list.
