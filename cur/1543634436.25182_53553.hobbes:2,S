I was using this version in an environment and I preferred not to change
this variable because I wouldn't had time to notice if it broke, but of
course I should upgrade soon, thanks for the reminder :). For your tree

course.

I didn't need it in any environment, and I usually try to avoid any
driver update in -aa except in case I can test it somehow. However if
there's significant request for this I can as well add it (in particular
because it's unlikely to raise maintainance problems).
