Subject: [PATCH 2.6.20-rc5 07/12] md: move raid5 parity checks to raid5_run_ops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/23/120

From: Dan Williams <dan.j.williams@intel.com>
handle_stripe sets STRIPE_OP_CHECK to request a check operation in
raid5_run_ops.  If raid5_run_ops is able to perform the check with a
dma engine the parity will be preserved in memory removing the need to
re-read it from disk, as is necessary in the synchronous case.
'Repair' operations re-use the same logic as compute block, with the caveat
that the results of the compute block are immediately written back to the
parity disk.  To differentiate these operations the STRIPE_OP_MOD_REPAIR_PD
flag is added.
