 The kernel used was a 2.6.23-rc5 snapshot from Sep 4th, 2007 taken from 
the linux-mips.org tree (as stated by the revision of the patch provided).  
There is no version that can be considered working as the change to add 
the printk() to register_console() went in before drivers/serial/zs.c was 
added and the old drivers/tc/zs.c driver might have been to sloppy to 
handle such bits as the transmitter enable properly.  I may investigate.
 Chances are nobody tried any version of the kernel from the period 
between the printk() was added and drivers/tc/zs.c removed with the 
DECstation; I have not.
 Anyway, I did confirm keeping the transmitter enabled all the time makes 
the problem go away.
