I'd love to see a generic API that OS's could use to interface with
BIOS-level SMI implementations. Something provided in ACPI data. For all
I know, there already is something generic, but I've not heard of it?
It'd be really nice to have generic functions like:
disable_random_vendor_extensions_crap()
disable_all_non_essential_smis()
or whatever else.

Yeah. The more of this stuff, the better I think. So if someone wants to
help me polish what I posted then cool - it's in our "MRG" internal tree
already in the current form since we're only using it for debugging now.
Jon.
