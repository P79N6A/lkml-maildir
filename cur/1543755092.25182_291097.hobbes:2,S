 as of 2.6.7-ish (last time i looked: 2.5 months) there was
 no forwarding of security: in fact there was nothing in any of the
 APIs about security at all: in fact, root as a user was banned (with
 good justification iirc)
 also, the xattr handling was (is?) non-existant and i had to
 add it, but it was unsuitable for selinux, and that's a design
 mismatch between fuse's way of communicating with its userspace
 daemon (err -512 "please try later") and selinux's requirement
 for instant answers (inability to cope with err -512)
 so i started to look at lufs instead, which appeared to be a much
 cleaner design.
 lufs expects the userspace daemon to handle and manage inodes,
 whereas fuse instead keeps an in-memory cache of inodes in
 the userspace daemon, does a hell of a lot of extra fstat'ing
 for you in order to guarantee file consistency, that sort of thing.
 there is an API / library which your userspace daemon is expected to
 use: this library handles the communication to the kernel and also it
 handles the inode proxy redirection and cacheing for you.
 lufs has a heck of a lot more examples available for it than fuse
 does.
 that all having been said, i don't think lufs's API has any
 security handling either.
 six of one, half a dozen of the other, but if you wanted fuse
 to support selinux and any other form of security that involves
 extended attributes, you would definitely have problems: i didn't get
 round to evaluating lufs for selinux (ran out of time and money).
