Yes, i'll try to do it this weekend... Since i need to keep this box
running most of the time.

Kernel.org, it's the only flavor =)

The major bit is, this worked with single core with reiser... Someone
else reported problems with XFS lately though, i'll have to read all
about it...

Well, flakey and flakey, it's been running with pretty heavy network and
io load for 4 days now... (with forcedeth, but there is no ethtool
interface for disabling TSO, if that is the problem)
The sky2 driver tended to just die and lockup the box after a while, but
i haven't tested Stepehns recent changes yet since i want something
reliable first, to i have a base for comparison.
Oh, Btw:
free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers
cached
Mem:       3056436    3039052      17384          0       4804
2001672
-/+ buffers/cache:    1032576    2023860
Swap:            0          0          0
If the memory was faulty, i'd have a corrupt filesystem by now imho...
=)
Btw, sorry about being unclear, i spotted it after i mailed, but...
Running without nvidia drivers on a nvdidia card is pretty horrible on a
desktop machine, the kind of resolutions you can get would have been ok
on a amiga, but with X, everything is sooo much bigger... =P
Also, sorry about the CC comment, but it took a day for your mail to hit
my inbox, ie a day after it appeared on lkml, must be the greylists
being overly efficient... =P
