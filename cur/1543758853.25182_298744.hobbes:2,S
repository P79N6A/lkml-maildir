It's worth retaining a paragraph for the changelog.

We don't take mmap_sem during page reclaim.  What prevents the page from
being freed by, say, kswapd?

I forget.  I do recall that we decided that the change was OK, but briefly
looking at it now, it seems that we'll fail to move a
PageReferenced,!PageActive onto the active list?

Feedback from s390, sparc64 and ppc64 people would help in making a merge
decision.

Well.  We need some solution to the page_table_lock problem on high SMP
counts.

How much less efficient?
Does anyone else have that code around?
