I'm not sure what it is I've got here.  I just tried to restart boinc, 
which hadn't run here in 10 days or so, cause its not housebroken yet 
IMO, and got this in the shell I started it from after a failed 
connection to berkeley attempt, followed by a repeat access:

Can any sense be made from this?  This is 48-33 with the two items 
mentioned before in this thread disabled.
