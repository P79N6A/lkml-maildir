It might just have been cpufreq. That nearly hits everybody with cpufreq
unless you have a pstate invariant TSC; and that's pretty much
always the case on older laptops.
It used to not be that drastic, but since i386 switched to the
generic clock frame work it is like that :/

The rewritten sched_clock() i still have queued does just that. I planned
to submit it for .23, but then during later in deepth testing
on my machine park I found a show stopper that I couldn't fix on time.
Hopefully for .24
