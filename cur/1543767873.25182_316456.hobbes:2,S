No, that's not the situation, we talk about.
UML runs its child with ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL).
The syscall-interceptions do not use *real* signals. Instead, before
and after it calls the syscall-handler, entry.S calls syscall_trace(),
which again uses ptrace_notify() to inform the father.
The father will see an event similar to the child receiving SIGTRAP or
(SIGTRAP|0x80), but there will be no signal queued and do_signal() will
not be called.
UML does all changes to its child on these two interceptions. It reads
syscall-number and register contents from the first syscall-interception,
writes a dummy number to the syscall-number, restarts the child with
ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL) and waits until the second interception for the
syscall happens. Next it internally executes its syscall-handler for the
original syscall-number and writes the resulting register contents to
the child. Now syscall-handling in UML is finished and the child is
resumed with ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL). Host's do_signal() is not called
while doing all this.
UML does not know, whether a signal is pending or not. It would not
even help, if there would be a way to retrieve this information. A
signal still could come in between retrieving the info and the child
being scheduled after ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL).
If there is a signal pending for the child, entry.S now jumps to
sysc_return, which again jumps to sysc_work, which calls do_signal()
exactly once. As trap still indicates a syscall, do_signal() possibly
modifies psw and gpr2, which makes UML fail.
The signal is not related to the syscall. UML does not know, if it is
delivered while returning from syscall, with do_signal() changing
registers, or later, without changes from do_signal(). So UML can't
undo the changes done by do_signal().
To UML the signal is an interrupt, and normally when returning from
interrupt it doesn't want to modify child's psw or gprs. So UML
normally does not modify psw or gprs on signal interceptions.
Having said all this, unfortunately I don't see a way to satisfy UML's
need with the current host implementation.
