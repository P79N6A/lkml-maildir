Close.
Probably it would be better to take the intersection of
(group->cpumask, p->cpus_allowed), and skip the group if
the intersection is empty.
In addition to that, do a patch for find_idlest_cpu that
skips cpus that aren't allowed. You needn't do the cpumask
check each time round the loop, again just take the
intersection of the group->cpumask and p->cpus_allowed, and
loop over that.
Wanna do a patch for that?

I don't think it does anything ;)
