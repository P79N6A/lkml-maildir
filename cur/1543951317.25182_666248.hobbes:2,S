Sorry for bringing it up that late, but I haven't found any patches doing
the same for nfs/callback.c. What are the plans about this code? Can we 
start turning this to kthreads? Or is there some grand rework pending in 
this code, so that we will just duplicate someone's work or cause unneeded 
patches conflicts?
You see, this code is the last user of kill_proc(), which in turn is the
last user of find_pid() which (in turn) is about to be removed.
Thanks,
Pavel
