It's a fixed protocol, with servers installed on millions of servers.
The protocol is called SFTP and the server is part of the OpenSSH
package.  There's nothing I can change there.
And even if I could change the protocol, it's impossible to implement
full UNIX semantics with a userspace server.  Please think a bit about
it.

That's what is done currently.
But it's has various dawbacks, like rmdir doesn't work if there are
open files within an otherwise empty directory.
I'd happily accept suggestions on how to deal with this differenty.
Thanks,
Miklos
