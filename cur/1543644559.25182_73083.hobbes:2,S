{sigh}
Have people been ignoring all of the core driver changes that have been
happening?  Almost everything that is "struct device" now, with some bus
specific things tacked on (and those bus specific things are getting
slowly merged into struct device too.)
It would make more sense (if you continue this path of changes to the
kernel) to focus on the device, bus, and class structures.  That way you
don't have to create a usb_problem.h, iee1394_problem.h, i2c_problem.h,
i2o_problem.h, scsi_problem.h, ide_problem.h, etc.
thanks,
