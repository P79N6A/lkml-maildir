I think the problems it is solving are these:
 (1) What happens if "/" is _not_ exported?
 (2) What happens if some intermediate directory (say "/usr") is not
     accessible?
In the first case, the automounter just makes "usr" and "usr/src", say, in the
autofs filesystem, and then mounts server:/usr/src on that.
In the second case, the automounter relies on NFS letting it make intervening
directories it couldn't otherwise access to span the gap between "/" and
"src".
