No.  Let me try and persuade you.
There's three cases.
    1.  foo will always be NULL at the line in question so no need to
    `vfree(foo); foo = NULL;'.
    2.  foo will never be NULL at the line in question so `vfree(foo);
    foo = NULL;' is mandatory.
    3.  foo will sometimes be NULL, sometimes not.
In that third case, seeing
    if (foo) {
        vfree(foo);
        foo = NULL;
    }
tells the reader that we're dealing with the `foo *maybe* NULL' case
whereas
    vfree(foo);
    foo = NULL;
*suggests* the `foo is never NULL' case.  The reader has to remember
that vfree(NULL) is valid and bear that in mind.
If the reader is about to modify the preceeding lines, knowing the foo
may sometimes be NULL helps.  So I prefer the longer code here because
it better shows the intent of the coder and is more telling about the
state of db->dict.
If you're really keen to save lines, please axe the superfluous
three-line comments.  We read C here, they're unnecessary.
