Long trial-and-error session.  Deactivate code and see if it still does
crash to narrow down the code lines which trigger the lockup.  Once I've
figured that enabling the I/O-Windows triggers the lookup the guess was
easy ...

"SYSTEM BIOS R1.02"

0x1000 is critical too.  Activating the first I/O window only is enough
to hang the notebook on any APM activity.

I've also noticed this in the boot messages:
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xeb1d0, last bus=0
PCI: Using configuration type 1
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI: Using IRQ router PIIX [8086/7198] at 00:07.0
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 0 of device 00:0b.0
  got res[10000000:10000fff] for resource 0 of Texas Instruments PCI1410 PC card Cardbus Controller
  got res[10001000:10001fff] for resource 0 of PCI device 1033:00cd (NEC Corporation)
PCI: BIOS reporting unknown device 00:01
PCI: BIOS reporting unknown device 00:02
The "unknown device" looks suspicious to me ...
