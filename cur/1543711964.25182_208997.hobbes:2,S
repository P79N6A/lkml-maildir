I said one mprotect() to make the entire stack executable.  Obviously,
if you have multiple stacks, you need one call per stack.  Big deal.

And how is this a kernel problem?  There are other reasons why
applications need to know the stack extents (think garbage collector)
and it's entirely glibc's failing if it's difficult to determine the
stack extent.
