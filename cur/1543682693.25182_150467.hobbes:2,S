Hello all,
Finally decided to give a development kernel a try on an HP zt1180
laptop.  The kernel build went smoothly and I thought all was well
(well except I guess I've gotta figure out frame buffer support again)
until I started X and discovered that the mouse wasn't working.
I'm guessing this list doesn't allow attachments, and I don't really
want to splat all over everybody with the output I thought relevant,
so I've posted it on my website:
	
http://www.parts-unknown.org/hp-zt1180-dmesg.gz
	
http://www.parts-unknown.org/hp-zt1180-lspci.gz
	
http://www.parts-unknown.org/hp-zt1180.config.gz
wget should work.
Did I miss a configuration option or do some other stupid thing?
