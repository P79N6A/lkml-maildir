Subject: Complaint about return code convention in queue_work() etc.

I'd like to lodge a bitter complaint about the return codes used by 
queue_work() and related functions:
	Why do the damn things return 0 for error and 1 for success???
	Why don't they use negative error codes for failure, like 
	everything else in the kernel?!!
I've tripped over this at least twice, and on each occasion spent a
considerable length of time trying to track down the problem.
If nobody objects, I'll write a patch to change the convention for the
return values.  It doesn't matter how many places those routines are
called from; it'll be worth it.
