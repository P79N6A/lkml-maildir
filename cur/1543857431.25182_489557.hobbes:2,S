OK, this is going to break the merge from Greg's tree of generic HID 
layer, which was planned for today.
The merge will probably emit a large .rej files, due to the large blocks 
of code being moved around, but it seems that most of the changes which 
would conflict with the merge could be trivially solved by hand.
Greg, should I prepare a new version of the generic HID patches against 
merged Linus' + Dmitry's trees and send them to you?
Thanks,
