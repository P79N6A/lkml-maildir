As far as I could without having access to actual hardware, yes.
That means I've read through my changes and tried to verify them
visually/logically.
I've also compile tested it - it builds fine.
And I've also attempted to load it, and it fails (due to no hardware)
as it's supposed to.
Beyond that I'm unable to test it.
