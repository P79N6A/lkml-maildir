I've been struggling with an identically-manifesting regression on one of
my test machines for a week.  It's due to softlockup changes, and setting
CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP=n "fixes" it.
It sounds unlikely, but I'd suggest that you see if it's the same on your
machine so we're not both chasing the same bug.
