Setting PCD but not PWT (or the other way around) is yielding not fully
defined behavior (model specific) as per the doc, so it doen't seem to be
too good an idea to use this. However, adding PWT here may not be what
is desirable either (as it'll make the referenced memory UC unconditionally,
whereas WC is generally more desirable here). It would seem to me,
though, that PWT alone would be the better choice in this situation
(despite this also yielding model specific behavior).
