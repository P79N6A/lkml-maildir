Dear Adrian,
Thanks for the information.
Also Can you please give inputs regarding.....
I have an existing Linux 2.6.11 BSP for an AMD GX processor.
What would it take me to port the complete BSP to 2.6.12 kernel?
Can I prefer to work on 2.6.11 kernel which makes me get the system up in no time without any changes made?
I guess 2.6.11 kernel will work with just a recompilation over 2.6.11.12 kernel.
An inquisitive question about Linux kernels versioning ...
How do 2.6.(x).1 and 2.6.(x).12 kernels vary?
Regards,
Mukund Jampala

The latest, IOW 2.6.11.12 .
But note that the 2.6.11 branch is no longer maintained since kernel 
2.6.12 was released 5 months ago, and therefore lacks e.g. current 
security fixes.
