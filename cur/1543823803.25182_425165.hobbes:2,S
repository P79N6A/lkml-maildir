Returning 0 from read() is only situation when you can be sure you are at the 
end of file.  If you get short read(), it may be short due to EOF, but it may be 
short also because some error was hit - EIO and EFAULT are two which can occur 
almost always.  And only next read will either return that error (or some other 
error, or success if error condition disappeared meanwhile), or zero if it is 
really EOF.
