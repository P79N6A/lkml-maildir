Sure there is, assuming you deal about heterogenous clients.  I'm not 
sure Xen is (although that is, as far as I understand, being remedied), 
which might explain your different perspective.
Consider that this may not even be about Linux -- having these standard 
devices would enable, say, 'doze device drivers to be written and shared.

USB is evil in the extreme for this kind of stuff.  Although in theory 
you can have any HCI you want, in practice the ones that are implemented 
requires a very complex framework for full compatiblity.
