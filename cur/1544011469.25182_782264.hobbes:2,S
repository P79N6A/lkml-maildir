Last time (well, ignoring some report on ancient vendor kernel) I've seen 
this to trigger it wasn't the fault of the peer but ours (we sent past the 
advertized window and window ended up being shrunk to zero). I agree that 
the message as-is is not very good but your change is not very good 
either.

This won't apply to net-next on which you should base anything new (and
