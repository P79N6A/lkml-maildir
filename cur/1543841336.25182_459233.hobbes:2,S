Well, this assumes that you have a network interface which may not be the
case. For example I could have a bluetooth keyboard or mouse instead of
network card. And you are proposing a generic solution...

Input device is good since then userspace connects to all of them and
waits for that specific event. The key (or switch) may even be generated
by another device (for example reassigning a key on my AT keyboard).
But I would probably keep RF control and input device separate instead of
mixing into one abstraction layer.
