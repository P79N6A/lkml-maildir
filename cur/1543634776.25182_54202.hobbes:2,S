This is working great!
No more trouble with X (writing this mail with KMail in 2.5.24-dj2)
using these options:
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_AGP=y
CONFIG_AGP_SIS=y
CONFIG_DRM=y
CONFIG_DRM_MGA=y
turned preemt on a long time ago and never noticed anymore since I use make 
oldconfig, so if there was any trouble with preempt in 23-dj it is fixed now
also the '__iounmap: bad address d0802030' message is gone thanks to Andi.
so it looks solid (at least for the 10 min it is running (seti@home) now)
