The damned bus doesn't even exist. If this is a case that couldn't be
detected, I'd not be complaining, but this is just nonsense having
a driver claim that its found an EISA device, when there aren't even
any EISA slots on the board.

This happens long after bus initialisation should have already figured
out that the bus doesn't exist. Even if it was left this late, the
eisa registration code should be doing a 'oh, I've not even checked
if I have a bus yet, I'll do it now' before it starts doing completely
bogus things like checking for devices.
The way I see it, EISA bus support is completely horked right now.
