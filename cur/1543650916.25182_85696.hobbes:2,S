Well in console mode:
MOUSETYPE=ps2
XMOUSETYPE=MouseManPlusPS/2
FULLNAME="PS/2|Logitech MouseMan+"
XEMU3=no
WHEEL=yes
device=psaux
And in Xfree4:
    Identifier "Mouse1"
    Driver      "mouse"
    Option "Protocol"    "MouseManPlusPS/2"
    Option "Device"      "/dev/mouse"
    Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
Under 2.4 every thing works great so, but under 2.5 not, from dmesg:
...

In console (with gpm, it seems to works, but I don't use the wheel)
But under X: no wheel any more... 
Thank you very much,
