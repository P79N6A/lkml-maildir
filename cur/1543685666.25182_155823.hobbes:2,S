I think that instead of giving the CPU percentage, you should give the
CPU time used:
	CPU time used = CPU percentage * total time
This would give a more accurate measure of how much CPU is used by the
different filesystems.  As someone said, if certain operations are
faster with reiser4, you expect a greater percentage of CPU time to be
spent in the disk driver etc. - if the amount of I/O is the same, that is.
Another interesting statistic would be the number of blocks read and
written during the test.
