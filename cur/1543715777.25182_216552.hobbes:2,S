In the wonderful Good Ol USofA, I think it would be trivial to apply
the DMCA: A character string following the appropriate convention
(null termination) is a protection mechanism.
Breaking that convention is a cicumvention device.
If it can work for XOR, and gets someone thrown in prison for 12
months, surely it will work for null termination?
Pretty clear cut, so, who's going to write this lovely company a
letter/send in the land-sharks (someone better, otherwise companies
will realise very quickly that they can stamp all over us with no
retribution[1])? I don't own any relevant copyright, unfortunately.
[1] Has anything been done about the other members on the hall or
shame?
