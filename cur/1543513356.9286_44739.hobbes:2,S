In netuse.lists.linux-kernel you write:

Because it was asked on the list: The disk is a 10000 rpm IBM
Ultrastar 18 and the swap is in the fastest zone of this disk.
This was the fastest disk they could get on short notice. The
disk is monstrously noisy when seeking. :-)
Question: How would the kernel benefit from additional
information about user space memory when swapping, had Linux a
madvise() call? Is it useful for the kernel to know that a
certain block of memory is always addressed sequentially or that
a certain block of memory should be swapped en-bloc?
