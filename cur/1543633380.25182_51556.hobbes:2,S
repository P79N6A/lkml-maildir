With a 9 month old, going on 2, in the house, I've been made painfully
aware of the need to have some way to lock the CD-ROM tray. I saw a post
about some patches way back in 1996 to enable user-space control of
this, but haven't seen much in the way of tools to control it. 
Is there any straightforward way of disabling the buttons on the CD and
locking all the time? I'm not averse to an ugly hack to 2.4.18+ source
if necessary.
Any suggestions?
