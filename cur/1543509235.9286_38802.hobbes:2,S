I think this is generally a GREAT thing, and something I've wanted for
a long time, but never got around to doing.
However... I think we can't just grab the module parameter name and
use that as a boot parameter name: each module currently has its own
"namespace" for parameters, and you're going to get tons of conflicts
this way.  For instance, there are tons of things like:
  MODULE_PARM(io, "i");
  MODULE_PARM(debug, "i");
etc.
There are two options for dealing with this: either invent a standard
naming convention (i.e., "io" becomes "3c501_io") and live with that
for both module parameters and boot parameters, or, have a way of
specifying a prefix just for boot parameters, like:
__setup(MODULE_PREFIX #var "=", modparm##var##_setup);
I tend to prefer the prefix thing because I think it would cause less
disruption.  Module parameters could still use the short form everyone
expects.  Driver updates would consist of just adding a macro for the
prefix.
It would also be nice to parse more of the argument classes, including
the array-of-int things.  But that can be added later.
