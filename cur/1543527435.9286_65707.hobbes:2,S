i'd love to do this as well, but there is one big problem: the SMP-config
parsing code has to run ASAP, before any memory is destroyed. It can be
anywhere in the BIOS sections of the lower 1MB RAM. So allocating and
initializing page tables will cause problems. We could allocate page
tables from above 1MB, but this is just yet another implicit 'reserve
memory' thing we tried to get rid of via bootmem :-)

yep, i agree. I gave it a quick shot and we crash in smpboot.c line 864,
which crash can be explained because smp_boot_cpu_id is taken from the MP
config table.
