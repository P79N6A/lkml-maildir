I think Greg spoke a bit hastily here. Input_devs do not directly talk
to the hardware and do not control power management and do not define
access methods for the hardware therefore using bus abstraction would
be wrong.

We should never let multiple drivers control the same piece of
hardware (in all cases where you would you can always split that piece
into smaller pieces, each controlled by its own driver). Input
intrefaces, on the other hand, are not drivers in regular sense, they
do not alter behavior of the underlying hardware. They just provide
different "views"/interfaces for the same device and because they
don't touch the hardware there can be many of them attached to the
same device. This is the crucial difference between them and normal
drivers.
