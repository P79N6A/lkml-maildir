OK, I figured that's what you meant.  The top-level ops are similar in
nature to inode_ops in that there's not a real compelling reason to make
them per process.  The process context is (usually) available, and more
importantly, the object whose access is being mediated is readily
available with its security label.

I think the current setup would work fine.  It's less likely that we'd
want a separate security module for each container than simply policy
that is container aware.
