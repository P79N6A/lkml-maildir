Really?  Yuck.

These system calls are too recent to use in the next two Debian
releases.  In addition, we can't really be sure that all libraries use
the new calls.
I find the design of the CLOEXEC business somewhat revulsive, by the
way.  It reminds me of those DoSomethingEx APIs in another platform.
The *_at system calls are a similar wart.  Even with this stuff, I
still can't safely open a file with a different effective user ID in a
multithreaded application, or create a AF_UNIX socket with specific
file system permissions.  Some thread-specific context with what have
been traditionally considered per-process attributes might have been
better. 8-(
