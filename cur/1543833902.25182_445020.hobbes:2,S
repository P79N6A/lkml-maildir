Porting V3 to anything is insane.  Why would you even consider it?

Linux vs. BSD's namei is the difference between thinking you know how to
do things and everyone should be forced into your mold, and thinking
that someone will always be more clever, at the very least with regards
to some special case you could never have anticipated.

Or just create a parent directory and skip the metafs.  Look, I don't
much care about the other details of coding it, but if you are changing
!'s to /'s, as an architect my intuition says something is wrong and
being papered over.  /'s are just fine, and what the block devices do is
elegant.   You are doing a quick hack.
