Thats an excellent question, unforch I don't know the definitive 
answer.  But to put that fear to rest, my / partition is on 
/dev/hda7, and /root is on /dev/hda5.  I would think that if thats a 
problem, I would have seen it, and I've been setup that way for the 
last 6 months or so.
That really shouldn't make any more difference than putting /usr on a 
seperate drive does, which is no diff, at least here.
Sorry Pablo, but I'm fresh out of ideas.  But there may be enough 
clues here that someone else can chime in.
