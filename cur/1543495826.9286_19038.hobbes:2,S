Hi Gregory.

Be sensible!!! "1 month" depends on who's measuring it, and when. The
test should run in continuous mode for 5 weeks, which is a much more
precice measurement of time...
Also add the requirement that any system crashing outside of office
hours shall remain crashed until office hours are again reached, and
define "office hours" as Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm, or something
similar. That will simulate the typical company system, where there's
nobody onsite outside the said hours to deal with suchlike crashes,
even if they knew how to...
Best wishes from Riley.
