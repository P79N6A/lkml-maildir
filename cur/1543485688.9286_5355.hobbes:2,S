2.2.0 changed the semaphores to being recursive. This broke the new
style SCSI error handling. So far the 1542 driver is the only driver
that uses it, so won't see it with other SCSI controllers. 2.2.2
probably will contain a fix - I hope it will just revert the semaphores
change because it is not needed anymore.
