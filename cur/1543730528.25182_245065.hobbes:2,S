Unrelated fix. Unaccount VM_DONTCOPY vmas properly; the child inherits
the whole of the parent's virtual accounting from the memcpy() in
copy_mm(), but the VM_DONTCOPY check here is where a decision is made
for the child not to inherit the vmas corresponding to some accounted
memory usages. Hence, unaccount them when skipping over them here.
