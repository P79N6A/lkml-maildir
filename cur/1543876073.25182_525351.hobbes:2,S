(3) make sure all existing kobjects are released by module exit function.
For example, let's say there is a hypothetical disk device /dev/dk0
driven by a hypothetical driver mydrv.  /dev/dk0 is represented like the
following in the sysfs tree.
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.0/dk0/{myknob0,myknob1}
Owner of both attrs myknob0 and myknob1 is mydrv and opening either
increases the reference counts of dk0 and mydrv and closing does the
opposite.
* When there is no opener of either knob and the /dev/dk0 isn't used by
anyone.  Reference count of dk0 is 1, mydrv 0.
* User issues rmmod mydrv.  As mydrv's reference count is zero, unload
proceeds and mydrv's exit function is called.
* mydrv's exit function looks like the following.
  mydrv_exit()
  {
	sysfs_remove_file(dk0, myknob0);
	sysfs_remove_file(dk1, myknob1);
	device_del(dk0);
	deinit controller;
	release all resources;
  }
The device_del(dk0) drops dk0's reference count to zero and its
->release is invoked immediately.
This method is widely used to allow modules to be unloaded even when
there still are valid objects if there's no active user.

Yeap, this is confusing.  Hope my explanation makes sense.
