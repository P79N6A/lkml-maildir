Be very careful with this change btw. The dmi_ident strings are unmapped
at the point dmi_table() returns. That means you can only use them in
the decode callback, and so it seems odd to export them. It certainly
wants clear documentation if you are doing it that way. 
What you probably should do is create some flag bits for i2c/smbus and
set those then export the flag data (we do the same for APM), rather
than export them as globals
