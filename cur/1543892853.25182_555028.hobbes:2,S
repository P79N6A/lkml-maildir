Hi,
I sent a message to the list yesterday describing a problem using via
hardware and a ps/2 keyboard for console input yesterday.
The reason I posted a description to the kernel mailing list is because
I have used the same software/hardware combination for some time and
only noticed the problem after upgrading the kernel from 2.6.13.2 to
2.6.20.
Seems like an obvious regression so I was wondering if I could get some
help resolving the problem here?
