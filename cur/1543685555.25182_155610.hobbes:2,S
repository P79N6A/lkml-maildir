A symbol can have only a single type and the warning is a bit misleading, 
the new type definition is simply ignored.
I'm not sure what you're trying makes really sense, but you have to use a 
separate symbol:
config BLK_DEV_PS2_B
	bool "PS/2 ESDI hard disk support" if !BROKEN_MODULAR
config BLK_DEV_PS2
	tristate "PS/2 ESDI hard disk support" if BROKEN_MODULAR
	default BLK_DEV_PS2_B
