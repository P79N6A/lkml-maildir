Today I tried with compile the kernel 2.6.1 with:
IGNORE word93 Validation BITS (IDEDMA_IVB) = y
The result looks a bit better, got 30MB/s at /dev/hda and 37MB/s at /dev/hdc
(38MB/s and 55MB/s at kernel 2.4.20)
Still very strange, /dev/hda and /dev/hda are exactly same model harddisk.
Also, the result still can't compare with my another much slower machine
Celeron / ICH4 / 2 x WD 120GB (md1), which got 46MB/s at both /dev/hda and
/dev/hdc,
Kyle
