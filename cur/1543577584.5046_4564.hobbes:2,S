However, there's supposedly the same problem for sparc32, because the ISDN
support for the amd7930 apparantly never worked (it wasn't even
selectable in the kernel-config), and thus the corresponding files in
drivers/isdn/hisax were removed. Looks like this broke the sparc build.
Is anybody willing to work with me on resolving this?
