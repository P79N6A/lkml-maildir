Sorry, can't do it.  It's already history (deleted).
Check the kernel mailing list archives -- it should
be in there.
If you don't know about the archives, check the
trailer message for the location of the FAQ.
The FAQ contains pointers to several archives.
Another thing you could do is ask about
USB on the USB mailing list(s) and/or read
the "USB Guide".  These are all listed at
www.linux-usb.org.
