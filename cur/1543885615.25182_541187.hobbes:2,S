By the way, we've just tried a 2.6.20.11 kernel on another machine
and so far (fingers crossed) we're not seeing the load issues we
had with the 2.6.19 kernel we were using.
Given that the Areca driver is the same in both, the only other funky
thing we did was a single patch to ReiserFS, but we're applying that
same patch on 2.6.20.
(my sneaking suspicion was that the delayed bitmap loading was to blame,
but it's hard to test these things short of multiple reboots, and we
don't have a testing Cyrus install that we can load that heavily)
Anyway - if this goes well for the next couple of days we'll probably
stop tracking the 2.6.16 series.  Thanks again, very much, for your work
with 2.6.16.  It was fantastic to have this resource to keep us from
having to chase more recent kernels just to get the patches we needed!
