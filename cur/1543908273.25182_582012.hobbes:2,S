Subject: [PATCH 5/20] Introduce struct upid
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/10/120

From: Sukadev Bhattiprolu <sukadev@us.ibm.com>
Since task will be visible from different pid namespaces each of them have to
be addressed by multiple pids. struct upid is to store the information about
which id refers to which namespace.
The constuciton looks like this. Each struct pid carried the reference counter
and the list of tasks attached to this pid. At its end it has a variable length
array of struct upid-s. Each struct upid has a numerical id (pid itself),
pointer to the namespace, this ID is valid in and is hashed into a pid_hash
for searching the pids.
The nr and pid_chain fields are kept in struct pid for a while to make kernel
still work (no patch initialize the upids yet), but it will be removed at the
end of this series when we switch to upids completely.
