OK.  The ELF flags bit is even more free, then... ;-)

Sure.  Theoretically, none of this matters at all (thanks to
mprotect()), so we're justs talking about raising the barrier.  With
PT_GNU_STACK, it's sufficient to tweak one bit in any dependent
library, whereas with the ELF flag bit, you need to tweak one bit in
the main executable.  Not a huge difference, I'll submit, but from an
admin perspective, I find it a lot easier to check the main program to
see if it has the "executable stack/data" bit set rather than all
dependent libraries.  Additionally, we could easily choose to drop
support for the ELF flag bit altogether.  The only program that I know
of that ever needed executable data was XFree86 and that was only due
to an oversight---and that has long been fixed.

That's why there is mprotect().
