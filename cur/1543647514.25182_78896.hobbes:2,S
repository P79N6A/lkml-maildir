# [PATCH] Compaq PCI Hotplug bug fix
# 
# Found the bug.  The following patch fixes the hot plug
# driver so that it has a fallback when there are no unused
# IRQs on a system.  At some point intialization got re-
# ordered and this was broken.
# 
# Greg, this should apply to 2.4 and 2.5 if you wouldn't
# mind submitting it.
# 
# Thanks,
# Dan
