Ben you seem to be under misapprehension that except for the case of
ISA (0-16) the linux IRQ number is a hardware number.  It is an arbitrary
software enumeration, and I think it has been that way a very long time.

I can only tell you that my impression of this last is that all the
world's not a PPC.
I have a version of the x86 code with a partial conversion done and
I didn't need a reverse mapping.  What you call the hardware interrupt
number never happens to be interesting to me after the system is setup.
I do suspect there may be an interesting chunk of your ppc work that
probably makes sense as a library so other arches could use it.
