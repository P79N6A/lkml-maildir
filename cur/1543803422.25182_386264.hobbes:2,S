Before 2.6.15, the lm90 driver did not handle read errors in any way,
so they were probably already there, you simply were not aware of it.
However, I guess that you already had the "command never completed"
errors? These come from the i2c-ali1535 bus driver.
It would be possible to add a retry-on-failure mechanism in the lm90
driver. However, the real problem is more likely in the i2c-ali1535
driver so fixing this one driver would be preferable.

Do you also have "command never completed" errors without an associated
error from the lm90 driver? This would suggest that the eeprom driver
too is triggering errors, which in turn would confirm that we need to
fix the i2c-ali1535 driver rather than adding a workaround to the lm90
driver.
It looks like the i2c-ali1535 driver as it exists in the lm_sensors CVS
repository (for Linux 2.4 kernels) did receive a major change in March
2005. These changes were supposed to "fix stability problems" (by
adding delay loops pretty much everywhere). They were never ported to
the Linux 2.6 version of the driver. Maybe we should try doing so now.
This is a 400 lines patch, porting it won't be trivial, I am not
familiar with this driver myself and I don't have a chip to test my
changes on, so if someone else wants to take his/her chance, go. If
not, I'll do it.
Andrey, will you be able to test a i2c-ali1535 patch if we come up with
one?
