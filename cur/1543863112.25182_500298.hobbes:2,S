That's not bad at all ! I suspect that if your system becomes unresponsive,
it's because real writes start when the cache is full. And if you fill
512 MB of RAM with data that you then need to flush on disk at 14 MB/s, it
can take about 40 seconds during which it might be difficult to do anything.
Try lowering the cache flush starting point to about 10 MB if you want
(2% of 512 MB) :
# echo 2 >/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio
# echo 2 >/proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio
I see nothing wrong in your measures nor messages.
Regards,
Willy
