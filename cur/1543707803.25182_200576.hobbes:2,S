We settled that question in this case, see Paul's "surrender" above ;)

Again, we (everybody who cared to jump in) now agree on what is sane here, 
it's quite logical.  As for supplying background material so this makes sense 
to a wider group of people, sorry it's been on my to-do list for a while.  
Getting a DFS, namely Sistina GFS, into the tree is underway as you know from 
the press release, however turning the ship takes time.  Meanwhile, the api 
discussion can't wait because the rudder on that ship is even smaller.
