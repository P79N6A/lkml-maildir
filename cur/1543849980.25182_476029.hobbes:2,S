∃ machines with more than one individual AC adapter. Which want
individual notification when one of them goes down.
You're right that they don't necessarily fit into the 'battery' class,
but I'm not entirely sure if it's worth putting them elsewhere, because
the information about them is usually available in the same place as the
information about the batteries, at least in the laptop case.
The simple case of AC adapters, where we have only 'present' or
'absent', is a subset of what batteries can do. If you have more
complicated monitoring, then it's _also_ going to bear a remarkable
similarity to what you get from batteries -- you'll be able to monitor
temperatures, voltage, current, etc. So they're not _that_ much out of
place in a 'power supply' class.
It makes _less_ sense, imho, to have 'ac present' as a property of a
battery -- which is what I've done for now.

For selected properties, yes. I wouldn't want it happening every time
the current draw changes by a millivolt but for 'battery removed' or 'ac
power applied' events it makes some sense.
For sane hardware where we get an interrupt on such changes, that's fine
-- but I'm wary of having to implement that by making the kernel poll
for them; especially if/when there's nothing in userspace which cares.

It's signed.

Welcome to the 21st century.

No, it can't. The Watt is not a unit of current.
I intended the ACPI 'present rate' to map to the 'charge_rate' property,
which is why we have the 'charge_unit' property. I don't like that much,
but it seems necessary unless we're going to do something like separate
'charge_rate_mA' and 'charge_rate_mW' properties.
Actually, I suspect that on reflection I would prefer that latter
option. DavidZ?

Yes, feasibly. I don't quite know what the 'destroy' bit in the OLPC
embedded controller is supposed to mean, and 'FIRE' seemed as good as
anything else.
