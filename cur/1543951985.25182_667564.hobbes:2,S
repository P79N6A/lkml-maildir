None of those really demonstrate the potential effects of your
proposed change. Even 1 million file sequential create and delete
will not stress it. It won't be until you need to hold that
million dentries in memory to prevent disk lookups while an
application generates significant memory pressure that you will
notice the difference. Without the dentries pinning the inodes,
they'll get reclaimed and need to be fetched from disk again....
FWIW - in trying to understand this a little more, I just checked my
idle test box just after boot and realised something:
$ cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
12723   8709    45      0       0       0
$
That means 12723 allocated dentrys, 8709 unused. That means ~4000 in use.
If the limiting test you are using is:
       if (dentry_stat.nr_dentry > nr_in_use * dentry_unused_ratio / 100)
               prune_dcache(dentry_stat.nr_unused * 5 / 100 , NULL);
We need to have (4000 * 10000) / 100) = 400,000 allocated unused, cached
dentries before they get pruned back. i.e. the working set of dentries I
can currently have is 400,000.
I've got 24GB RAM on this box, and often I want to cache 10,000,000 inodes.
Under this algorithm, I'll need to pin 100,000 dentries to allow the cache to
grow this large or tweak a knob. Therein lies the problem....
Effetively, the dentry_unused_ratio is saying that for every node in
the dentry tree, we allow (dentry_unused_ratio / 100) cached leaves
distributed throughout the tree. At dentry_unused_ratio = 10,000
that gives us 100 leaves per node in the tree.
i.e. if your directory heirachy is deep, then you can cache lots and
lots of inodes because you pin lots of dentries as nodes in the
tree.  But If you have a flat directory structure, there will be
relatively few nodes pinned and you can't cache as many inodes.
IOWs, the size limiting aspect of this algorithm is biased in
exactly the wrong direction. It grows without bound on filesystem
traversal (and hence fails to prevent the condition you want to avoid)
yet prevents caching lots of file dentries if you have a shallow
directory structure (can affect normal application performance).
To prevent the first, you need to tweak the knob in one direction,
and to prevent the second, you need to tweak the knob in the
other direction. We try to avoid adding knobs that require ppl
to tweak them all the time to get optimal performance.
I think we're better off trying to fix the traversal issue....
Cheers,
Dave.
