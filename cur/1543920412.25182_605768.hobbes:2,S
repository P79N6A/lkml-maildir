It's a good point to always consider when you analyze how something
new should work if it's used with older programs too. But with newer
things like SMP or multithreading they probably have more choice, and
you can only guess what it's done 'officially'.

The failure of an architecture doesn't mean all specific new
technologies used in itanium were failure too, so they could be back
when needed (and nothing better in reserve) yet.

I don't think 'not breaking' is much problem here, rather how to use
all new features (which you seem to ignore a bit) to get maximum of
performance without breaking older things. Or, like current problem:
go rational and remove useless (acording to new specs) things, even
without performance gain, or stay 'safe'?
