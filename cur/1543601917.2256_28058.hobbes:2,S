I am not sure the megaraid breakage is from that patch at the moment. There
is another 2.4.10pre change which seems to alter the request size limits for
the megaraid.  I don't know where this came from but it was not discussed
on the megaraid list or posted here by any megaraid folks. Given the 
megaraid firmware is umm "fragile" anything that changes what we feed it
really does want to go through the AMI/Dell people.
A secondary issue is that 64bit DMA is only correctly handled by certain
MegaRAID firmware. The checks for this are not correct until 1.1.17a-ac
in some cases (eg HP rebadged board with H.01.07 and H.01.08 firmware)
