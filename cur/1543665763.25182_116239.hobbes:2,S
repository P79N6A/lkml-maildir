I think it's not easy. I haven't studied the code completely yet, but e.g. 
when you attach a device to a driver you also have to get a reference to 
the driver.
I think there are more interesting races, e.g. when you create a sysfs 
symlink, that symlink might also have references to a module.
bye, Roman
