Yes, we can but...
1. As I wrote in the other reply, I don't think that's necessary.
Devices don't spin up on FLUSH_CACHE followed by STANDBY_IMMEDIATE when
they are in Standby state. (Please point out if this isn't true on most
drives)
2. As the code currently stands, we have to rely on SCSI HLD for
shutting down.  We can query power state there and issue shutdown
conditionally and all those will be properly translated by libata but
it's a bit complex.  I'm not sure whether the added complexity is justified.

I think that can be dealt with separately.
Thanks.
