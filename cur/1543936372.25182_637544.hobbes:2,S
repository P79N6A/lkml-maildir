The third rc for the next feature release GIT 1.5.4 is available
at the usual places:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
  git-1.5.4.rc3.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
  git-htmldocs-1.5.4.rc3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  git-manpages-1.5.4.rc3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  testing/git-*-1.5.4.rc3-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)
Sorry, this is a few days late than I promised.  Partly due to
day-job pressure, partly because I am not familiar with RPM spec
file and ended up failing to get the spec file into a reasonable
shape after gitk i18n merge more than twice, and partly because
I involved myself to discussion on the list I should not have
been deeply involved in during the rc freeze.
In any case, we managed to keep the changes only to fixes (both
code and documentation) this round, aside from the promised gitk
i18n enhancements.  This should be pretty much the same as what
we will have in final, hopefully due by the end of the month.
Please give it a good beating.  Especially if you care about the
final RPM, and you are familiar with RPM generation, I would
appreciate extra set of eyeballs to see if dependencies and
other metainformation is set up correctly, as I do not think
many people have tested it.
