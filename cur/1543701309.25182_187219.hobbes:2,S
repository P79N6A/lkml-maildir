It would be nice to be able to see all the hotplug CPU patches in one
place, to get a feel for their shape and size.  That way, we can decide
whether we need to look at this patch ;)

If the calling task has a signal pending, this could become a tight loop?

In what state is this schedule() called?  If it's TASK_RUNNING (or
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE with signal_pending()) and this task has rt priority
higher than the thing it is waiting for we could have a problem?

`kthread_create' sounds like the name of a function to me, not a structure.

I was right! ;)
It would be nice to kerneldocify kthread_create(), kthread_start() and
kthread_destroy() sometime.

If the calling task has higher rt priority than *k, could this not become a
busy loop?  It would be preferable to use a real sleep/wait primitive here.
