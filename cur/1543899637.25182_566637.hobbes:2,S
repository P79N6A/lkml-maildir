The challenges in doing that are analogous to the challenges in
suspending to RAM, for which it has been agreed that drivers should be
fixed such that the freezer is not necessary.
The hard part of hibernate is not creating the snapshot; rather, the
hard part is writing the snapshot, and allowing the user some
flexibility in how and where the snapshot is written.  The kdump
approach allows complete flexibility in writing the snapshot
(essentially any kernel or user space facility can be used), while not
interfering at all with the snapshot state.
