Nevertheless, this process does malloc and malloc returns the requested
memory. If a malloc fails the computer algebra process has the choice
between various alternatives. Present a prompt, so that the user can
examine variables and intermediate results, or request a dump to disk
of the status of the computation. Or choose an alternative algorithm,
at some other point of the space-time tradeoff curve.
But no error return from malloc - just "Killed". Ach.
