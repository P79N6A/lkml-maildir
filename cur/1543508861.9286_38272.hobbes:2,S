  Hello.
  I'm sending you fix of small bug in quota. The problem was that if you turned user quotas
on, opened some file, closed the file and turned group quotas on than if you did chgrp
quota didn't take effect on that file. I know it's improbable but it's a bug. Please
apply following patch. It is against 2.2.11.
						Honza.
