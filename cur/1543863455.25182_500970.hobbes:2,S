	No, you can't have sysfs and configfs functionality in the same
exact portion of the tree.  But you can use both sysfs and configfs at
the same time in your driver.  The different parts will appear in the
different trees.  Up to you.

	There is no guarantee, but that's a bug.  The attribute handling
code came from sysfs.  I assume the initial assumption was that since
you can only copy a page, it's OK.  Clearly not the case.  sysfs fixed
this in October (commit 035ed7a49447bc8e15d4d9316fc6a359b2d94333).  I'll
be porting that over.  Thanks for noticing!

	Hmm, interesting.  I'll look at that as well.
