Hm, no, I found the real one (although HFS has the problem):
# modprobe ppp_deflate
Warning: loading /lib/modules/2.4.18+preempt/kernel/drivers/net/ppp_deflate.o will taint the kernel: non-GPL license - BSD without advertisement clause
I'm pretty sure the "BSD without advertisement clause" license should not
taint the kernel, should it ?
And even if there is an obscure license incompatibility, there is a problem
in that this module is in the stock kernels, and should then be advertised
as such (or maybe removed).
