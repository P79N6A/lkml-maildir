So we are going to waste that space in _all_ kernels just for Intel P4
being stupid? I compile fernels for _486_! At home I have a Duron.
I don't want to pay "P4 tax" ;)
Also, once it gets cached at first access, subsequent accesses won't
hurt that much, right?

You definitely need to play with objdump -d just to see those 7.5 bytes
everywhere.
Pipeline flush is moot, you have jump penalty regrdless of alignment.

I will do.
Let me say this clear:
	If you do million iterations loop, maybe you should align it.
	It is very dumb to align everything in the hope it will
	magically make your kernel run 2x faster.
