Subject: [PATCH] mm/memory.c locking comments fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Some of the comments in and before handle_pte_fault() are obsolete or
misleading:
- page_table_lock has been pushed up into handle_mm_fault() and down
into the various do_xxx_page() handlers.
- mmap_sem protects the adding of vma structures to the vmlist, not
pages to the page tables.
