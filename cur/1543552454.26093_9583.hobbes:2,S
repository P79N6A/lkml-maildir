Hi,
 I am getting a kernel panic when I boot linux.
 There is some bad block.
 To get rid of this, I want to run fsck.I boot linux
 with a boot diskette and then with rescue.img I get
 to the command prompt and then run fsck.
 #e2fsck /dev/hdb5 //hdb5 is my linux native
              
 when I run fsck I get following message:
  
  Group decriptors look bad... trying backup block...
  e2fsck:Bad magic number in superblock while trying
  to open /dev/hdb5
    The superblock could not be read or does not
describe a correct ext2 filesystem.If the device is
valid and  it really contains ext2 filesystem(and not
swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock is
corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an 
 alternative superblock: e2fsck -b 8193 <device>
 I run
  #e2fsck -b 8193 /dev/hdb5
  I get the same message as I got above.
 How can I get my linux back?
  
  with regards,
    Anil
