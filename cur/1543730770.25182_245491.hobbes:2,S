I've done that.  You should send a patch to Pete to do the same for the
2.4 tree too.
I'm very sorry it's come to this, I really am.  
I'd like to personally thank you for all the time you've spent in
working on this driver over the years, and wish you the best in whatever
you do in the future.  Come back anytime.
