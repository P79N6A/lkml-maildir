Hi all,
I've found a worrying rounding error which is manifested by the 
following simple test program.
I ran this on linux2.0.26, and compiled with gcc version 2.7.2
double	d1 = 2.4,
	d2 = 1000,
	d3;
func1( double val )
{
	printf( "%ld\n", (long) val );
}
func( long val )
{
	printf( "%ld\n", val );
}
main()
{
	d3 = d1 * d2;
	printf( "func( (long) d3 ) -> " );
	func( (long) d3 );
	printf( "func( (long) (d1 * d2) ) -> " );
	func( (long) (d1 * d2) );
	printf( "func1( d1 * d2 ) -> " );
	func1( d1 * d2 );
}
This produced:
func( (long) d3 ) -> 2400
func( (long) (d1 * d2) ) -> 2399
func1( d1 * d2 ) -> 2400
The second line of output manifests the rounding problem. 
I compiled and ran exactly the same program on Non-StopUX with the 
native C compiler and Win98 using M$ 32-bit compiler version 
10.20.6166 which both produced the correct value on the second 
output line.
Would anyone like to comment?
