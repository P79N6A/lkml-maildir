Well, ioctl cannot configure IP aliases, however. Indeed, it may be
useful to change the patch to not touch the SIOCS* functions and
document that it only accesses the first one.

That's true, but I would not want to make SIOCGIFADDR behave differently
than SIOCGIFNETMASK, in that case, I'd rather have SIOCGIFCONF just
return the first address per interface name.
I will prepare a new patch as my time permits (unless, of course,
someone is faster).
