Subject: Bugs sitting in the RESOLVED state for more than 2 weeks

These bugs have been sitting in RESOLVED state for more than two weeks,
ie, they have fixes, but aren't back in the mainline tree (when they
should move to CLOSED state). If the fixes are back in mainline
already, could the owner close them out? Otherwise, perhaps we
can get those fixes back in?
