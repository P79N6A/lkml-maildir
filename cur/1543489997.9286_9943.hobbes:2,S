I'm having a problem with recording audio with my MediaGXm 233,
I am using the sb module with kernel 2.2.3
/etc/conf.modules:
alias sound sb
options -k sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=0 dma16=5
When I try to record a sound, my computer just freezes totally, here's a
example command:
dd bs=8k count=4 </dev/audio > sample.au
I found that command in the the ESound TIPS file
 it's that easy to record sound to a file? hehe..no. its that easy to
freeze the computer..
I can't get the midi or the joystick to work either.
if I try to insmod sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=0 dma16=5 mpu_io=0x330
Mar 15 11:44:27 neuron kernel: Too much work in interrupt on uart401
(0x330). UART jabbering ??
Mar 15 11:44:27 neuron kernel: uart401: bad devc
I'm sure those are the correct parameters,
I know that the MediaGXm is a lame computer anyway & if I had an extra
isa slot then I'd just install a real sound card.
why was support for the MediaGX TSC removed from the kernel? I know it
has a TSC, maybe its buggy (probably, knowing how cyrix is.). 
would it perform better using the TSC?
I used to be able to compile the kernel for a pentiumpro and run it on
my  MediaGXm, in fact I try to compile everything for the pentiumpro
because it sports a nice performance inprovement.
I use pgcc.
Later, 
Jon
