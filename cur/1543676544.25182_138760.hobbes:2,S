In the mean time, we started experiencing the same behavior on routers
that have only ethernet interfaces, a web server and my personal
workstation. All machines run kernel 2.4.20-ac1, and downgrading to
2.4.19 seems to solve the problem in all cases. I am now pretty sure
that I am not experiencing bad hardware.
I am now running my personal workstation with 2.4.21-rc7, but cannot
comment on that kernel at the moment.
Are there any known stability issues with 2.4.20-ac1?
Greetings
Marc
