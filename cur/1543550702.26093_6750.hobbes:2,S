in 2.4.0-test9, kampd is taking up between 70% and 80% of cpu usage on my
Celeon 300A box. This is a fresly compiled kernel, Ill list some stats:
Celeron 300A
Asus Motherboard
64 Megs ram
APM enabled in BIOS
Ne2000 ethernet card
S3 PCI video card
This is based on a redhat 6.2..
Any ideas? I'll be happy to do as much as I can to give whoever needs it
better errors (files in /proc, better description of problem, etc). Just
let me know...
Geoff
