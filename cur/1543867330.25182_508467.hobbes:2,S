Subject: [PATCH] 9p: add write-cache support to loose cache mode
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/13/359

Loose cache mode was added primarily to asssist exclusive, read-only
mounts (like venti) -- however, there is also a case for using loose
write cacheing in support of read/write exclusive mounts.  This feature
is linked to the loose cache option and is disabled by default.
This code adds the necessary code to support writes through the page
cache.  Write caches are not used for synthetic files or for files opened
in APPEND mode.
