Don't know about the problem you seem to experience. But it seems your
machine is completely broken both with 2.4.10 and 2.4.1[12]. A kernel
compile on such hardware that lasts 40 minutes is absolutely unusual.
My PC is a 166 Pentium (even no MMX), 64 MB RAM, and a hard disk that
bonnie reports having a maximun R/W performance of only 4 MB/s. With this
hardware, and kernel 2.4.11, a compilation of kernel 2.4.12 + some 
modules (100 in total), also running icewm, X 4.1, Mozilla, Xchat,
gkrellm, xawtv, several rxvt's and more, total compilation time for kernel
+ modules (make dep clean bzImage modules) is 65 minutes. And, in the
middle of the compilation, cron.daily was run.
So maybe there is a problem with kernel 2.4.1[12] on your setup, but it
seems that also your base hardware is not working as it should.
Greetings.
