Hello,
drivers/usb/net/KConfig mention the word ROM ('Read Only Memory') a few
times in combination with the Sharp Zaurus family. The original software
from sharp (and clones) use cramfs as a root partition which indeed is
Read only. OpenZaurus however (and other distributions like Familiar)
use jffs2 as a filesystem for the rootfs on flash, so ROM is not the
correct term to use. Attached is a patch which removes the word 'ROM' in
the sentence mentioning OpenZaurus.
regards,
Koen Kooi
