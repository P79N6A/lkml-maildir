I don't think there are a lot of people who load ip_conntrack and insert
a single DROP rule on their servers just to workaround weaknesses in the
TCP stack. If they did, they would not be more confident into netfilter
either because it would be logical to expect the same reasoning (eg: let's
not fix XX here, TCP will catch it).
What's the problem with the sysctl ? If you prefer, I can change the patch
to keep the feature enabled by default so that only people aware of the
problem have to fix it by hand. But I found it better the other way : people
who need the feature enable it by hand.
Cheers,
