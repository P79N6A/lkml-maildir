I do not think this is 32MB-related. We had server with 32MB-bug
running happily for pretty long time. (Well, sometimes gcc segfaulted,
but we had to live with that).

Yes: random segfaults. About once a day, processor will make a mistake
leading usually to a segfault. About 30 faults/day with heavy
load. Not good.
