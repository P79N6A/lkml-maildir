Yeah. In some configurations 2.4-rmap takes care of this
automagically since part of the replacement isn't as
pressure driven as in 2.4 mainline and 2.6, ie. some of
the aging is done independantly of allocation pressure.
Still, inter-zone balancing is HARD to get right. I'm
currently trying to absorb all of the 2.6 VM balancing
into my mind (*sound effects of brain turning to slush*)
to find any possible imbalances.
Some of the test results I have seen make me very
suspicious...
