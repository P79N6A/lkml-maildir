	Ok , There isn't a sysctl available to do that .  I am also a
	little worried about the 'none' in ths below .
root@udragon:~# sysctl -A | grep -i parp
dev.parport.parport0.devices.active = none
dev.parport.parport0.modes =
dev.parport.parport0.dma = -1
dev.parport.parport0.irq = 6814784
dev.parport.parport0.base-addr = 2198696099840	0
dev.parport.parport0.spintime = 500
dev.parport.default.spintime = 500
dev.parport.default.timeslice = 200
	But I do see timeslices in the 'lp' of /proc/...
dir /proc/sys/dev/parport/parport0/devices/lp
total 0
   0 dr-xr-xr-x    2 root     root            0 Apr 17 17:26 ./
   0 dr-xr-xr-x    3 root     root            0 Apr 17 17:26 ../
   0 -rw-r--r--    1 root     root            0 Apr 17 17:26 timeslice
	Off to build 3 kernels on this old tub .  Twyl ,  JimL
