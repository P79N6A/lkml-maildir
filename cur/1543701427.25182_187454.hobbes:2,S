Subject: [PATCH] disable gcc warnings of sign/unsigned comparison
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
Please consider applying the following patch.
This patch turns off all gcc warnings on comparing signed with unsigned
numbers, by setting the gcc option -Wno-sign-compare in the top
Makefile.
These warnings state:
  warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
This patch is a "personal preference" decision.  If you choose to
reject it, I seek no justifications.
I like it, and at least with the version of gcc I happen to be using
(3.3), find it really helps.  This version of gcc dumps out many such
complaints otherwise.
And one could make a case that Linus would like this patch, from his
remark of a couple months ago, on a thread with the Subject of:
  [PATCH] irda: fix type of struct irda_ias_set.attribute.irda_attrib_string.len
in which Linus wrote:
> That's why I hate the "sign compare" warning of gcc so much - it warns 
> about things that you CANNOT sanely write in any other way. That makes 
> that particular warning _evil_, since it encourages people to write crap 
> code.
But what Linus actually thinks of this, I've no further clues.
The patch was computed against 2.6.0-mm2.
Thank-you for your consideration.
