So far, so good.

How would options be passed when loading?  Some modules require that
to load properly.  Also, there are lots of options that can't be
changed after loading.  To enable this, I believe the whole option
handling would need to be modified substantially.  Instead of just
storing the values in static variables, there would have to be some
means of telling the module that its options changed.  Then there's
the task of hacking all modules to support this...
