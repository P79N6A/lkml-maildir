Agreed that we *need* dtable's; but be careful: there is no 
way to accomplish short lookups in masq if we use BOTH
"normal" and "reverse" (portfw) masq 
Maybe we could put some fuzzy and do
  in demasq path:
      if (dport >= PORT_MASQ_BEGIN) 
           lookup mtable           (normal masq) 
      else
           lookup dtable
