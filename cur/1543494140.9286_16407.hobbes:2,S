Subject: Wanted: bitmask (or something tike that) of free interrupts

I want to probe only the interrupts witch are not marked as busy.
Donald Beckers approach to probe only if 
if (  request_irq(*irqp, NULL, 0, "bogus", dev) != -EBUSY) {
...probe for irq...
}
does not work for me since request_irq first checks if the heandler is
NULL and returns another error than EBUSY. (I think otherwise this
approach would lead to lots of polling ethernetcards)
And probe_irq_on only returns 0x12345678 and not a bitmask of interrupts
as promised.
How do I get my free interrups, then? Could I install a real
interrupt-handler in request_irq? that would be dangerous, wouldn't it?
please reply to schuldei@nord.de so the mail reaches me soon!
