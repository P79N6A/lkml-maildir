The problem is that the numbers don't actually mean anything, even to 
the bios.  They are only there for backward compatibility with real mode 
software that makes int 13 calls.  The bios just fakes the geometry 
anyway so it can emulate something, but there really is no meaning to 
the geometry; it's just smoke and mirrors. 
In the case of dm, which geometry should it report?  In some cases it 
might make sense to pass up the values from the bios, but in most, there 
is no sensible way to choose what to report, and any value you do report 
is meaningless gibberish anyhow, so why bother at all?  Just bring the 
apps still using it ( grub, lilo ) into the 21st century and have them 
stop using these meaningless values in the first place.  LBA has been 
around for a good 10 years now, so I think it is safe to no longer 
require these made up values to support CHS addressing.

dmraid is only one client of the kernel device mapper.  It has numerous 
uses that have nothing to do with hardware fakeraid, including LVM.  In 
the special case of dmraid there is a bios int13 dev for the raid that 
provides some geometry, but why hack dm for this special case when it is 
totally unnecessary in the first place?
