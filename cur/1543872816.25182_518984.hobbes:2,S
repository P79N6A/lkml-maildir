The test scenario was one any desktop user might do with every
expectation responsiveness of the interactive application remain intact.
I understand the concepts here Con, and I'm not knocking your scheduler.
I find it to be a step forward on the one hand, but a step backward on
the other.
Tossing in the SMT nice comment was utter bullshit.  All kernels tested
were missing SMT nice.

Unless you target accurately.

I'm not trying to find fault, I'm TESTING AND REPORTING.  Was.
