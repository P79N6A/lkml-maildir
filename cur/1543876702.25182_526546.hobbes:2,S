there's a different type of regression now: under high load i dont get a 
crash, i get a hung interface instead. No error packets or other weird 
interface state - just a hung interface. The condition happens after a 
stream of:
 eth1: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
 eth1: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
 eth1: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
 eth1: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
 eth1: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
If i increase max_interrupt_work from 5 to 50 to paper over this 
condition then the hangs go away. So i suspect there might still be a 
queue-wakeup problem in one of these paths - or that a filled up tx ring 
somehow gets stuck. (and i've got commits 3ba4d093fe8a26f and 
fcc5f2665c81e08, so all the latest stuff that is upstream at the moment)
