Yes, C1 is the name they gave for what the idle loop does automatically.
this should be monitor/mwait -- if available -- but currently in ACPI
mode C1 is hard-coded to use HALT -- a bug.
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2280
So if your processor has monitor/mwait, and C1 is the best idle state it
has, then you'll probably actually run cooler right now in idle if you
do not load the acpi processor driver.  (but if you've got C2, it should
do better than C1 anyway)
That said, I don't know what caused the regression you describe. 
Perhaps you can clarfiy the minimal changes necessary to switch between
correct and incorrect behaviour?
thanks,
