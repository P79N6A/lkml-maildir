This define is not actually used anywhere that I know of.  I just wanted
to be consistent and correct, following what was previously done.  I
have been wondering if I should be adding devices to the pci_ids.h file
that are not being currently used.  It seems like most drivers are not
using these defines and are just using the DID's directly.  In the
future, should I only be add devices that are actually using the defines
somewhere?
Thanks,
Jason
