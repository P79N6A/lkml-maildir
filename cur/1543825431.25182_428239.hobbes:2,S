Again, this is driver specific. But for ide-cd, if it's using PIO the
right thing should happen since we do each chunk individually. For dma
it looks much worse, since we only get an EIO back from the hardware for
the entire range. It wont do the right thing at all, only for the very
last thing when get get past the last bbbbbb block.

Probably it should be even more aggressively scaling down. The real
problem is the drivers of course, we should spend some time fixing them
up too.
