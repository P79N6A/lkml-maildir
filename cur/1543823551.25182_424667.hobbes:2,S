Hmmmmmmmm.
I've worried that it can or can't be done. These codes look like midway of
registering hierarchies, because all of arch's parent_node() is just
parent_node(nid) = nid. I guess someone would like to make real code at
here. But, these might be just wrecks too. :-(
Ok. I'll try consolidate once. If there is a person who would like to
make something at here, he will complain. :-P

Oops. Indeed.
