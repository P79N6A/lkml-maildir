Because the function as it is written is useless, but with
changing from "clear_bit" to "set_bit" it would be - at least partly -
useful, I still believe, it is a bug. Does anybody know, who is
responsible for the function?

For sure, not easy.
But tasklet_kill will mostly be called in process context, won't it?
