Right, I need to isolate the effects of each variable. Results for gcc 
3.4.4 and 4.0.2, built with CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE enabled, appear
below. Pardon the bad methodology.
$ size vmlinux.*
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
2333474  461848  479920 3275242  31f9ea vmlinux.344.inline
2327319  462000  479920 3269239  31e277 vmlinux.344.noinline
2319085  461608  479984 3260677  31c105 vmlinux.402.inline
