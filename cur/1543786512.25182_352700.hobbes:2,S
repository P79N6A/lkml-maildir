Agreed - that would be a better configuration interface, but I don't see
why we couldn't support module parameter arrays too. Especially since
the changes are minimal and don't break the ABI/ifenslave
compatibility/etc.
IMHO the "primary" semantics are completely broken right now and this
is a possible fix for it.

Yup, arp_ip_target is one parameter which doesn't lend itself to this
scheme and this is exactly why the patch doesn't try to fix it.
