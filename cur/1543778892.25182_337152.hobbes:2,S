These bugs don't happen too often in reality.
Just please don't be malicious and add this kind of code deliberately. :)
Every build breaker wastes my precious time to fix it. 
That's compulsive/obsessive in some way. ;)
On the contrary, my "just break it" desktop is destined to have
it's HDD contents overwritten once in a time.
That's what these spare disks/computers are for, aren't they?
All the data on that computer is volatile, all (not too frequent) backup is
mostly made through the network and checked from the stable computer.
If I really needed it very stable, I wouldn't test Reiser4 on it, less so
a development kernel. That's why my stable machine uses latest release kernel,
and only after it's broken in by at least a week.
