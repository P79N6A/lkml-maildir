That is because it is not an "exported" symbol.  Modules cannot access
it: all modules have to use the exported interface.

It really should just allocate a fixed size, selectable by the user.  It
sounds as if your driver allocates these pages on demand but doesn't
release them on demand, and that's bad behaviour in the Unix environment.

Trouble is, even if there _is_ lots of memory available at the time the
driver loads, the user or admin may be wanting to use it for something
else.  You simply can't let a driver gobble up all "available" memory on
the assumption that nobody else will want to use it.  Using a sane
default buffer size and letting the user specify a larger buffer when
the driver is loaded makes much more sense.
Cheers,
 Stephen
