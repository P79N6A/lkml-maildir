This is alive and well in 2.6.13 (final) on ia64.  Excerpts from dmesg
when booting:

When I'm up and running, measure the speed of sda and sdb:
# hdparm -t /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   62 MB in  3.02 seconds =  20.56 MB/sec
[This is VERY consistent from run to run, 20.56 MB/s every time].
# hdparm -t /dev/sdb
/dev/sdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:    2 MB in  4.04 seconds = 53.79 kB/sec
[Speed on sdb is very erratic ... 53.79 KB/s is the worst I saw in half
a dozen tests ... but first try after boot was 47.14 MB/s, and I see
intermediate rates all over the map: 545.42 KB/s, 5.13 MB/s, 32.61 MB/s]
dmesg shows some messages like this:
mptscsih: ioc0: >> Attempting task abort! (sc=e0000001fceb4c80)
mptbase: ioc0: IOCStatus(0x0048): SCSI Task Terminated
mptscsih: ioc0: >> Attempting task abort! (sc=e0000001fceb5080)
mptbase: ioc0: IOCStatus(0x0048): SCSI Task Terminated
mptscsih: ioc0: >> Attempting task abort! (sc=e0000001fceb6e80)
mptbase: ioc0: IOCStatus(0x0048): SCSI Task Terminated
mptscsih: ioc0: >> Attempting task abort! (sc=e0000001fceb7a80)
mptbase: ioc0: IOCStatus(0x0048): SCSI Task Terminated
Sometimes there are floods of these, other times just a few ... e.g. I
saw just those 8 lines after ten iterations of "hdparm -t /dev/hdb".
