Hello
I am looking into Documentation/devices.txt in 2.4.25 and eth0 is not listed
there. If I grep "eth", I get only
38 char        Myricom PCI Myrinet board
[...]
"This device is used for status query, board control and "user level
packet I/O."  This board is also accessible as a standard networking
"eth" device.  "
and then
/dev/pethr0
Is eth0 some kind of special device that doesn't have any number
assigned?
