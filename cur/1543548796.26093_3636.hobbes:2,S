This is a xconfig feature. xconfig stores values for dependancy disabled
variables changing the variable values (they are not equal to "n" neither
undefined). That way the following (otherwise config-langauage.txt
compliant) cases do not work:
- when the same config variable is used in different active instructions
  (bool, tristate, dep_*, etc), even if they depend on contradictional
  conditions), eg:
- when define_* instruction is located *before* an active instruction using
  the same variable (your example).
Fixing xconfig in both cases would need its total rewrite so, IMHO, it is not
worth to do it. I see two solutions of this problem:
1. reverse the condition (simpler, but with a side effect):
  if [ "$CONFIG_6xx" != "y" -a "$CONFIG_PPC64BRIDGE" != "y" ]; then
     bool 'QSpan PCI' CONFIG_PCI
  else
     define_bool CONFIG_PCI y
  fi
2. use other temporary config variables to handle this case (more
   complicated, but working better):
  unset CONFIG_PCI_6XX
  ...
  if [ "$CONFIG_6xx" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_PPC64BRIDGE" = "y" ]; then
     define_bool CONFIG_PCI_6XX y
  else
  # CONFIG_8xx
     bool 'QSpan PCI' CONFIG_PCI_8XX
  fi
  ...  
  if [ "$CONFIG_PCI_6XX" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_PCI_8XX" = "y" ]; then
    define_bool CONFIG_PCI y
  else
    define_bool CONFIG_PCI n
  fi
