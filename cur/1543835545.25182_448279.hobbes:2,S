Generally I'd agree with you, but my initial objective is to resolve
all (or at least most) of the clashes with as little pain as pssible
initially so that we can get to the point where we can add -Wshadow to
the Makefile - sometimes the path of least resistence is making the
local name longer.

Here I changed the global to be longer - config_filename.

made the local longer - guilty as charged.

I don't recall using that variable name - I believe you mean 'intr'
for interrupt that I used in place of 'irq'.

I'd *love* to change this one - and down() as well - to up_sem() &
down_sem(). But, making that change would be a pretty major and
somewhat disruptive api change, so I opted instead to change the local
variable names. I plan to introduce a sepperate patch set later on
that adds up_sem()/down_sem() wrappers around up()/down(), deprecate
the old names and add an entry to feature-removal.txt - but doing it
now as part of the -Wshadow cleanup would be too much pain.

Yes, here I made the local name longer. Long term that should probably
change. Short term it seemed the path of least resistance.

i don't think you are. It's just that I want to take the least
intrusive route *now*, make us -Wshadow clean, get -Wshadow to be an
accepted part of the Makefile, *then* deal with the more
intrusive/controversial renamings, where I guess you'd have done
things in the opposite order - right?
