   Why do all the rio tools insist on doing raw port inb/outb's?
Portability, mostly.
   We have this nice parport layer for sharing parallel ports between devices,
Which I plan to use for my Rio FS, eventually.  Unfortunately, the
documentation for the parport layer is not so great (and um, not so
existent), so it'll take me a little while to figure it out.
