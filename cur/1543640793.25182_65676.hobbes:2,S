I don't think there are any other pid ones. I've no idea what libc4 used
but I don't think I actually care . 
On the kernel side I found a ushort pid in coda, but I can't actually
easily tell if thats a process id or a coda thingy. We have some other
sloppy pid users but they all appear to be int (eg vt_kern.h)

I have to admit I've not looked. I know of one (older AberMUD) which did
it for security tricks but thats hardly relevant to this nor a reason to
worry.
