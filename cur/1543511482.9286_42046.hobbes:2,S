   Except that I construct attacks to use massive amounts of AVL tree
   space.  Very easily in fact. On something like an appliance with
   8Mb of RAM that makes the AVL setup a non solution and something
   better is needed
It stands to argue that the same can be done for vm_area_structs's, so
why don't we punt those from the mm subsystem?
