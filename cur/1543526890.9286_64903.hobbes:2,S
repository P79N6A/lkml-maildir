Western Digital has it right. Rotating media might someday be about
as popular as core memory. ("core" = tiny wire wrapped magnetic bits)
IBM mainframe terminology is also correct. DASD is the term for a
"direct access storage device", meaning almost anything but a tape.

Yes, most UNIX(R) systems use /dev/dsk. This fits well with the
tradition of using 3-letter names. (dev tmp var usr etc...)
Only a GUI user could love the names we have now.
In fact, the new names remind me of what NT uses.
    multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)
Hmmm... the UnixWare names are much better.

Well, both are wrong. "disc" is merely worse than "disk".
I used to really want devfs in the kernel. The names were usable and my
system wouldn't need to depend on extra daemons.
I suppose devfs can still be used like /devices on Solaris.
This is far less useful. Here I am, an early devfs supporter,
and I really don't want to use the result.
