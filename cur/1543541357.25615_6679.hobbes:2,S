I don't understand that 'JFFS ought to be able to do XIP'.
There are some code for it?

Yes, we thought that the compressed file system is better than XIP.
But our client has an OS with XIP using Intel's FDI.
(If embedded linux is better, they will drop it)
we need to prove that the compressed fs is better than XIP
in point of performace and less use of memory.
Though we'll not use XIP, we must implemet it.
