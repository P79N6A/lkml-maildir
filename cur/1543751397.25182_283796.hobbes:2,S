Actually, the measurements I recall were using that
nasty usbfs-specific async API ... or using huge
buffers with the synchronous/blocking calls, so
the hiccups added by scheduling latencies didn't
kick in very often.

Or just doing something like gadgetfs, where the standard
Linux "libaio" calls work just fine.  I was certainly able
to stream 24 Mbyte/sec isochronous transfers (that's the
top speed possible with one high speed ISO endpoint).
The key point is that one userspace IOCB should map directly
to one URB in the kernel; and one userspace file (descriptor)
should map to one USB endpoint.  For a host side API, it turns
out that isochronous URBs already have limited scatter/gather
style support -- each one maps to several packets.
I think it'd be best to use the existing AIO support rather
than have usbfs2 create yet another USB-specific thing.
