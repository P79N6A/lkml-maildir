Note just the one "git pull" seems to fetch tags on its own now without
need for the last step.

If you intend to do apply patches against that particular version, you
could also create a new branch:
	git checkout -b my-v2.6.13-branch v2.6.13
or if you know from the start that you only want to update up to a
certain version,
	git pull tag v2.6.13
instead of just "git pull".
I did some work on a new tutorial under Documentation/tutorial.txt in
the git source tree:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/tutorial.html
which might be helpful, though it isn't so specifically targetted at the
case of linux testers.  It wouldn't be hard to write something like
that, though.  Git should make that kind of use pretty easy.
