Your assertion that these #ifdef-contained lines of code are "impossible
to maintain" is theatrical.  I'd prefer to wait until we actually have a
replacement before we go ripping out working code.  
Fortunately, I'm working on such code right now.  But as lguest
currently boots with V = P + PAGE_OFFSET, it's not entirely a trivial
matter to change.
Thanks,
Rusty.
