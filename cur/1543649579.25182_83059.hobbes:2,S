If you added something like this to netif_rx, I think it would accomplish
the goals of those who want to add their own hooks.  It would probably not
please the folks who want to keep this code out for GPL/political/legal/moral
reasons.
Note that the hook basically exists already in the bridging code.  It may
be illegal for GPL reasons to assign your own method to this hook, but I'm
sure you could put up a good legal fight if you wanted to (the bridge hook
is not exported GPL)
int netif_rx(struct sk_buff *skb)
{
	int this_cpu = smp_processor_id();
	struct softnet_data *queue;
	unsigned long flags;
+#idfef EVIL_COMPANY_NETWORK_HOOK_HACK
+       if (evil_hook) {
+          int rv = evil_hook(skb);
+          if (rv) { return; /* skb was consumed by evil hook, gawd help us all */ }
+        }
+#endif
	if (skb->stamp.tv_sec == 0)
		do_gettimeofday(&skb->stamp);

So, it would be ok to modify the driver to call a new hook, one that
may be over-written by proprietary code?  Otherwise, you have to write
a non-gpl driver....yuck!
Thanks,
