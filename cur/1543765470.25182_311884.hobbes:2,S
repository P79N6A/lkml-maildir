Hi,
I am trying to access the module list kernel data structure from a
kernel module. If I gather correctly, module_list is the symbol that
is the head pointer of this list.
This module compiles fine but when I try to insmod it, it say
module_list is unresolved symbol.
Does this symbol have to show up in the /proc/ksyms  ? 
It currently show up in the System.map file. 
What do I need to do to access this symbol.
Also, what do the three columns in the System.map file stand for ?
First col looks like the virtual address  and third looks like
function/symbol name. How do I read the second ?
thanks,
Allison
