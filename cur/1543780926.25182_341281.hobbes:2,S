The NPTL version of glibc (the TLS library) uses this.

You'll find getpid much faster with TLS libraries (it's cached, no 
longer a system call):
With TLS:
zach-dev2:Micro-bench $ time ./getpid
real    0m0.080s
user    0m0.080s
sys     0m0.000s
Without TLS:
zach-dev:Micro-bench $ time ./getpid
real   0m5.041s
user   0m2.520s
sys    0m2.520s
If you're feeling really masochistic, I've added a demonstration of how 
you can call sysenter from userspace without glibc.  The code verifies 
that there is no way to exploit the kernel to achieve reading arbitrary 
memory through a non-flat data segment.  It deliberately segfaults at 
the end.  Let me point out this is a very wrong way to do things - you 
should always use the vsyscall page, and in fact, this code actually 
depends on the vsyscall page even if it is not apparent.  I fake the 
same frame structure that the vsyscall page would have pushed to 
simulate a vsyscall entry, but the kernel will always return to the 
vsyscall page, which then returns back to us.  Fun stuff.  If you leave 
the kernel hack for ud2 in your kernel, I would expect it to blow up in 
amazing fashion when running the code below.
