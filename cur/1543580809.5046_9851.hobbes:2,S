Linux Kernel,
(Sorry, had one more change that did not make the patch.  this release
contains the corrected patch).
Version 1.1-6 of the Dolphin PCI-SCI (Scalable Coherent Interface) drivers
for Linux kernels 2.2.X and 2.4.X have been posted at 
vger.timpanogas.org:/sci.  These drivers are freely available under
the GNU public license and are provided in both RPM and tar.gz 
formats.
NOTES: 
This release corrects an SMP/non-SMP auto-detection problem during 
driver install. If someone is using an SMP kernel on a single processor
system, this version checks the kernel build tree to determine which 
option was built with the drivers in the /usr/src/linux/.config 
file prior to installing the drivers.
This version corrects a reported bug for those folks who compile 
an SMP kernel on a APIC supported single CPU system during driver
install.
Jeff
