Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Create a CFLAGS_REMOVE for ftrace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Recently David Miller ported ftrace over to the sparc64. When I mentioned
to him a way to remove the "notrace" from all the functions in some
files done by using a dirty little hack, David (correctly) called it
"Makefile turd" and told us to stop doing that.
I then asked if a CFLAGS_REMOVE_foo.o = -pg would be more pleasing, and he
agreed.
This patch series starts out by creating a CFLAGS_REMOVE_(basetarget).o
that removes options from CFLAGS to compile a target file.
The rest of the patches clean up the Makefile turd with this variant.
Note, I left the turd in the trace directory itself, just because (almost)
all the files there should not be traced. But that's a special directory,
and this patch series keeps the sewage in one place.
