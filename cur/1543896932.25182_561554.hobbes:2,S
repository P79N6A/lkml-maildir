Yes, that makes sense now that it's been explained to me conveniently. As long 
as a normal user is not left alone with such task (as it won't happen), I'm 
more than happy with the solution.

This adds even more sense to all the explanations I've heard up to now. 
Thanks :)

Yes, an app to change priorities would be very nice, though I'd be happy with 
just sensible defaults. Probably once CFS or SD go mainline more application 
developers will make their apps run at the appropriate nice level (or else 
distributions will provide this when packaging the apps), so end users won't 
have any problems.
