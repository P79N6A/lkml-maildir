Memory is memory.  Pushed from the stack or as a 4 byte immediate value you
still have to get those 4 bytes somewhere  although with the pointer you DO
actually stand a chance GCC might enregister the pointer variable.
Sure you don't think instruction bytes fetching is free ;->
BTW, I don't give a shit about the size advantage.  Put the 3 byte EBP ref
and the 5 byte push imm32 in a loop and measure them - I know what the
answer will be.
