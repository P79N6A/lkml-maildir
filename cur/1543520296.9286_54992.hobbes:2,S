Hi!
What means "frame" and "carrier" for a interface?
I have many carrier errors on a 3COM.
What's going on?
Card:
eth0: 3Com 3c905B Cyclone 100baseTx at 0xe400,  00:50:04:56:92:f2, IRQ 11
  8K byte-wide RAM 5:3 Rx:Tx split, autoselect/Autonegotiate interface.
  MII transceiver found at address 24, status 782d.
  Enabling bus-master transmits and whole-frame receives.
Thanks!
