Yes they, can: the allocation will fail, function will return -ENOMEM,
malloc will return NULL, pagefault will fail with OOM.  This is
progress, though not the best sort.  It is most certainly _not_ a
deadlock.

The amount of reserved memory that would be needed depends upon the
filesystem.  Some filesystems would need only very little to be able
to free some memory, some would need a lot (e.g. a bzip2 compressing
filesystem).  There's no magic solution with reserving memory.
And this is not unique to userspace filesystems, as Rik van Riel
pointed out earlier, network filesystems are also prone to deadlock:

Doesn't matter one little whit.  The end result is the same: Out Of
Memory, which is _not_ equivalent to deadlock.  Please think it over.
