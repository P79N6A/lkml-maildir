Hmm, when I wrote GFP_DMA32 it was a #define GFP_DMA32 GFP_DMA 
on ia64 so that drivers not need to ifdef.  Someone nasty
seems to have removed that too. I guess it would be best
to readd.

No, e.g. s390 and some other architectures still use it.
You'll need to bug their respective maintainers.

Not yet.

I would prefer for GFP_DMA to go away on x86 (but GFP_DMA32 stay). This way
we get clean compile errors instead of subtle breakage. Silently
changing the semantics would be bad.
But then it wouldn't make sense to have GFP_DMA on ia64 and GFP_DMA32
on x86. Since driver writers are more likely to test on x86
I would recommend ia64 having compatible semantics. It'll
save everybody trouble long term. This means it wouldn't 
help on IA64 machines that don't have a DMA zone -- they
would still need to validate drivers especially -- but at least
the others.
Also from my driver review driver authors often seem to have
trouble understanding what GFP_DMA really does. With GFP_DMA32 it 
is clearer that it applies to a address range and is not
some synonym for pci_map_*
