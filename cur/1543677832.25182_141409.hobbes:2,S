I'm still currently keeping the qlogic and feral drivers out of tree. 
Feral because Matthew Jacob thinks its not ready yet and Qlogic because
I was waiting for the must-fix list (I'll prod hch again for this).
You can get the current qlogic driver at
  
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-qla2xxx/
And I will update the BK tree at linux-scsi.bkbits.net
