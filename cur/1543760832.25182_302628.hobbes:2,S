    Hi all :)
    I don't know if I've had this error previously, I noticed it this
morning when recompiling the kernel *I already use*. When doing 'make
dep' I had this:
    make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/kernel'
    scripts/mkdep -- `find /usr/kernel/include/asm /usr/kernel/include/linux
      /usr/kernel/include/scsi /usr/kernel/include/net /usr/kernel/include/math-emu
      \( -name SCCS -o -name .svn \) -prune -o -follow -name \*.h !
      -name modversions.h -print` > .hdepend
    find: /usr/kernel/include/asm: Too many levels of symbolic links
    scripts/mkdep -- init/*.c > .depend
    I've break the long line invoking the 'scripts/mkdep' binary so
it's easier to read. I don't know why the heck 'find' fails with
ELOOP :?? Just a simple 'find /usr/kernel/include/asm -follow' causes
'find' to issue a open call that fails with ELOOP. I'm using version
4.2.18 (I updated recently my findutils) and version 4.2.15 doesn't
show the problem.
    I just wanted to warn everybody on the list about this problem.
I'm going to write to findutils people to report the bug.
