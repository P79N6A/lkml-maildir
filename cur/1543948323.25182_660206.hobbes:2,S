I noticed it while looking how well drivers/firewire/ (CONFIG_FIREWIRE*) 
and drivers/ieee1394/ (CONFIG_IEEE1394*) are compiled in -next; i.e. you 
can just check for the firewire ones as one example of potentially 
missing compiles.  On the other hand, I also saw some LDs without 
corresponding preceding CCs, so it rather looks like there was already 
something compiled.

OK, I will just look myself into the logs then.  Thanks,
