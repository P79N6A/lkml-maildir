This is not an Oops as your subject line states ... its a forced
filesystem shutdown due to (what looks like) corruption in a btree
block in a directory inode.

Is this reproducible?  In particular, is it reproducible if you take
some of the MD/loop/encryption complexities out of the picture (just
to try to narrow down the source of the failure).  And if so, could
you send me a recipe describing how to reproduce it... thanks!
cheers.
