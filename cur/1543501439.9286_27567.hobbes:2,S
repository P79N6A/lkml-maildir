Well we are hooking up our Linux PCs to our serial console system for
this very reason - it just has to be done. It also saves one from all
those silly console switches ;-) (though I think they will be kept
there).

Fine, take one box, hook up a serial line and wait. If it is that easy
to get a crash then you don't need to wire them all up.

I haven't seen it before, but there are some good reasons for it.

Before you can do this you need a hardware address for the receiver,
this can of course be done by putting it statically into this special
driver. Alternatively you need a fair amount of a network stack to run
before you can first get the hw address via ARP, and then send out a
message with the oops info. Now this requires a sorta functional
Ethernet driver to get anywhere and often your interrupts are dead.
So in principle one could hack something like this, but it will be
nasty, it will require a special Ethernet driver going in,
initializing the card from scratch (it could be the interface that
crashed) and then send out the packet.
To be quite frank, it is less of a hassle to hook up a serial cable,
I cannot see any reason why people keep refusing to do this.
