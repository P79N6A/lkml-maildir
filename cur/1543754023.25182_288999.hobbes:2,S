Sigh.. I guess you want me to do all the benchmarking. Well it's easy 
enough to get good results. I'll simply turn off all services and not 
run a desktop. This is all on ext3 on a fully laden desktop by the way, 
but if you want to get the results you're looking for I can easily drop 
down to a console and get perfect results.
