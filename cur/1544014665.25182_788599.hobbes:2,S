Core implemantation seems simple and the feature sounds good.
But, before reviewing into details, 3 points.
  1. please fix current bugs on hierarchy management, before new feature.
     AFAIK, OOM-Kill under hierarchy is broken. (I have patches but waits for
     merge window close.)
     I wonder there will be some others. Lockdep error which Nishimura reported
     are all fixed now ?
  2. You inserts reclaim-by-soft-limit into alloc_pages(). But, to do this,
     you have to pass zonelist to try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages() and have to modify
     try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages().
     2-a) If not, when the memory request is for gfp_mask==GFP_DMA or allocation
          is under a cpuset, memory reclaim will not work correctlly.
     2-b) try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages() cannot do good work for order > 1 allocation.
  
     Please try fake-numa (or real NUMA machine) and cpuset.
  3. If you want to insert hooks to "generic" page allocator, it's better to add CC to
     Rik van Riel, Kosaki Motohiro, at leaset.
     To be honest, I myself don't like to add a hook to alloc_pages() directly.
     Can we implment call soft-limit like kswapd (or on kswapd()) ?
     i.e. in moderate way ?
   
A happy new year,
