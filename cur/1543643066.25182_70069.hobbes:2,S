Again. We have 2^30 = 10^9 pids. In reality there are fewer than 10^4
processes. So once in 10^5 pid allocations do we make a scan over
these 10^4 processes, that is: for each pid allocation we look at
0.1 other processes. This 0.1 is a small number. As soon as you start
introducing structures that have to be updated for each fork or exit,
things become at least ten times as expensive as they are now.
Some polishing is possible in that code. I think I once gave a shorter
and more efficient version. The fragment "if(last_pid & ~PID_MASK);
last_pid = 300;" occurs twice, and the correct version has it only once.
The correct version does not have the "goto inside".
But, the code may only become smaller and more beautiful.
Large ugly code can be justified only by the need for efficiency,
and there is no such need here, and indeed, none of the proposals
made things more efficient. Once the number of processes gets
above 10^5 we can invent simpleminded schemes to make this
for_each_task faster.
