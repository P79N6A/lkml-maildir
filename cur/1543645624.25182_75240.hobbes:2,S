sorry, first dmesg output was from a boot with dma disabled in the bios.
drives are set to mdma2 (disk) and mdma0 (cd) in this case. with udma 
enabled in the bios the output is
hda: 78177792 sectors (40027 MB) w/1819KiB Cache, CHS=4866/255/63, UDMA(33)
hdb: ATAPI 52X CD-ROM drive, 120kB Cache, UDMA(33)
and the non working output had this as a copy and paste error. in fact, 
the kernel with piix support _always_ detects the disk as UDMA(33) 
regardless of what I try to disable DMA (bootparameters, bios) and then 
the errors follow.
