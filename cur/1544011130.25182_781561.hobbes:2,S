I plan to take it somewhere else - but I have only thought that I want
to avoid mixing generated files with source files.
This also depends on what we decide to do with asm-generic.
Arnd suggested to let kbuild geneate a set of wrapper files so we
was backward compatible with the files that do 
.. something ...
#include <asm-generic/...>
.. somthing more ..
and also files that just do:
#include <asm-generic/...>
Where the latter could simply be dropped as we would then search the
directory with the wrapper files first.
If we do something like that then we could save asm-offsets.h there.
In other words - hand wawing for now. I will revisit this when the rest
has moved. And there is really nothing preventing the last archs to move.

I sent Andi a patch where we also update the symlink so he could switch
source directory but keep output directory.
But in lack of feedback I have not included in in kbuild.

I will include it in kbuild soon.

Yes - I will try to remember.
