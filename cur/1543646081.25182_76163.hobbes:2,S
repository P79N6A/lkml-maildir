I can fix sparc, dunno about others. Do you have a problem
on sparc64? Are you using a huge page to map the kernel?

It's hell on earth trying to find them without __pa barfing
on addresses outside of linear area. Don't you think it may
be time to add a BUG_ON there, at least for 2.5?
I also toyed with idea of __pa which walks page tables.
The problem now is that every Joe Driver Writer on the street
started to use pte_offset(pmd_offset(pgd_offset())), which they
duly copy from bttv. Of course, highmem or other changes break
that, because it was not an API meant to be exposed. We kinda
let Kraxel to do it because there was no other way for V4L.
The idea of some virtual addresses more equial than others is
extremely hard to impart into heads of driver writers, in my
expirience. At least we have to invent a new term for vmalloc
area, such as "logical" address, and make Corbet to fix THE BOOK.
