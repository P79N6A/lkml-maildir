Sure. Even tried compiling it directly into the kernel.
Tried it with pre-2.3.32-4 today, and it works now, though, so whatever
the problem was, it's fixed.
I still don't get any autoprobing info (yes, I enabled IEEE-1284, and the
printer supports it), though. The autoprobe* files are in proc, but
they're empty.
