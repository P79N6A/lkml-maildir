Well, I have also done that of course. Both struct and u64 work well.
Since only kdev_t.h knows about the actual structure of kdev_t
it is very easy to switch.
--------------
typedef struct {
        u32 major;
        u32 minor;
} kdev_t;
#define major(dev)      ((dev).major)
#define minor(dev)      ((dev).minor)
#define mk_kdev(major, minor)   ((kdev_t) { major, minor } )
#define HASHDEV(dev)    (major(dev) ^ minor(dev))       /* arbitrary */
#define NODEV           (mk_kdev(0,0))
#define kdev_none(dev)  (major(dev) == 0 && minor(dev) == 0)
static inline int kdev_same(kdev_t dev1, kdev_t dev2)
{
        return (dev1.major == dev2.major) && (dev1.minor == dev2.minor);
}

(there are some defines in the tty code that have to be adapted,
that is all)

That would become rather ugly. The present situation is not u16,
it depends on the architecture. But unsigned int covers the
present situation on all architectures.
