Please point out where in the original post, the referrence to "defective"
media.  If this would have been the case, your point it valid.  If I
missed something, thus am wrong, I will admit to being wrong.
Warning (compare_maps): ksyms_base symbol
__io_virt_debug_R__ver___io_virt_debug not found in System.map.
  Ignoring ksyms_base entry
Unable to handle Kernel Null pointer dereference at virtual address 00000018
f08968f8
First how can the trace be meaningful if ksymoops detects a miscompare on
the system map?
Cheers,
