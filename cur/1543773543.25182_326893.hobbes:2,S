Sorry, the I-pipe is likely in the "none-of-the-above" category. It's
actually not much of a category itself. For one thing, it's clearly
not an RTOS in any sense of the word.
The I-pipe is just a layer that allows multiple pieces of code to
share an interrupt stream in a prioritized fashion. It doesn't
schedule anything or provide any sort of abstraction whatsoever.
Your piece of code just gets a spot in the pipeline and receives
interrupts accordingly. Not much nesting there. It's just a new
feature in Linux.
Have a look at the patches and description posted by Philippe last
Friday for more detail.

That's inconsequential. Whether Fusion is loaded or not doesn't
preclude a loaded driver to have a higher priority than
Fusion itself and therefore continue receiving interrupt even if
Fusion itself has disabled interrupts ...
The loading of Fusion would change nothing to these measurements.

What's being measured here is a loadable module that allocates an
spot in the ipipe that has higher priority than Linux and puts
itself there. Therefore, regardless of what other piece of code
in the kernel disables interrupts, that specific driver still
has its registered ipipe handler called deterministically ...
Don't know, but from the looks of it we're not transmitting on
the same frequency ...
