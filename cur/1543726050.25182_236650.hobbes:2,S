I'm not sure that's true, I personally think there is a lot to be said 
about the model currently being used for 2.2 and 2.4, which is almost 
totally bug-fix mode. Is that bad? The addition of minor fixes, like 
better scheduling, should not impact stability, let more massive changes 
(and feature deletions) be omitted. Is a new Reiser version likely to be 
more stable than what we have, or should this wait for a development 
version? Good, put it somewhere else.
I like to invert the arguments for putting new stuff in 2.6, let's go 
back to the excitement of development and open 2.7, and put 2.6 out to 
pasture right away. Then 2.6 can really be stable and 2.7 can go hog 
wild, without holding back the developers with pesky users.
