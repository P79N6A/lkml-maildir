Great, this will be useful output.  It will probably be a couple days 
before my next patch.  In the meantime, you can extract the bad commit 
to a patch
	git-diff-tree -p 268fe6f9f15551be9abedd44a237392675d529d5 > \
		/tmp/patch
and then revert it locally in your kernel tree
	patch -sp1 -R < /tmp/patch
to temporarily work around this.
I will definitely make sure this is either fixed or reverted before it 
goes upstream to Linus.
Thanks,
	Jeff
