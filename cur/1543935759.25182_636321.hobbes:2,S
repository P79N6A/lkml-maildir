then you have a truly ancient x86.git repository ;-)
think of x86.git#mm as an open development tree. It's high-flux, based 
against Linux-bleeding-edge, it's frequently updated (daily, sometimes 
hourly), breakages are possible (and likely) and fixes and other 
feedback is more than welcome. And please feel free to complain about 
patches that are included. (like you did in the past) Also please try to 
post your patches as early as possible instead of in big chunks - last 
week's 75 patches patchbomb from you was (and still is) ... challenging 
;-)

i have measured the impact of the barriers and it was in the noise 
level. Barriers are notoriously easy to get wrong (because almost 
nothing tells the programmer that they are wrong), that's why i did this 
barrier-safe rdtsc() [& friends]. We had so much trouble with RDTSC 
during the past 10 years of its existence that being a bit more 
conservative with it is the only really maintainable option.
