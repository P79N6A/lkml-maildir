It seems rash to make the change now, because there is no need for it.

For the skbuffs, we could use a mempool with GFP_NOIO allocation and
then skb_get them before the network layer ever sees them.  We already
keep track of the packets that we've sent out, so we'll just keep a
pointer to the skbuffs.

I thought there was some shared information at the end of the data,
but that's interesting, thanks.  I'll look into it.
