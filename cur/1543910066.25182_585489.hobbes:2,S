I'm surprised too. Numbers were from the "...use asm() like the other
atomic operations already do" thread. According to them,
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3434150  249176  176128 3859454  3ae3fe atomic_normal/vmlinux
3436203  249176  176128 3861507  3aec03 atomic_volatile/vmlinux
The first one is a stock kenel, the second is with atomic_read/set
cast to volatile. gcc-4.1 -- maybe if you have an earlier gcc it
won't optimise as much?
