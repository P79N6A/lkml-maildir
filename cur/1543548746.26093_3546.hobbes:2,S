This (IMHO) is wrong. When the drive has trouble keeping up
with requests in FCFS order, we should do some elevator sorting
to keep throughput high enough to deal with the requests we get.
Jeff's idea would take care of this, together with a *limited*
(say, 32 entries) queue size. Every time the "work" queue (the
one the disk is working on) is empty, we switch queues.
Processes get to put their request on the other queue, either
until the disk takes their requests (the queues are switched)
or until the queue is full. That way only the N highest priority
processes can get access to the disk if we're really overloaded
in a bad way.
The current HUGE queue size is probably another reason for
the very bad latencies we sometimes see...

Only if you were to allow unlimited merges ;)
I guess a 'decent' maximum size for one request would
be somewhere around 256kB, since this is the amount of
data a drive can read in the time of one disk seek...
