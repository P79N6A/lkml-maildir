At this point i should just step down and declare incompetence --
SBCL works around shlib size variance, somehow, and /yet/ the whole
turn-off-AS-randomisation-and-reexec-self thing is still present in the source,
for some reason.
I should let more competent people (read, the actual SBCL developers)
take the way from now...
(I could have digged the source myself, but it is way too late today.
However, if nobody from the development team answers by tomorrow`s evening (gmt+3),
i should see into the thing for myself).
