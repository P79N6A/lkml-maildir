Ah... mmap()ed writes + truncate()...
OK. There's currently a known problem here which appears both in 2.4.x
and 2.5.x: we appear to be incapable of flushing out all the dirty
pages prior to truncating the file. The usual
filemap_fdatasync()/filemap_fdatawait() appears to be subject to races
with VM swapping.
Could we have some help from the VM experts on this one?
Cheers,
  Trond
