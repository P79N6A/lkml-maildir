From my point of view it is important to preserve only all the determinated state.
Ok, lets we've checkpointed and saved current entropy pool. But we have not any
guarantee that pool will be in the same state at the moment of first access to
it after wakeuping. Because a new entropy can change it unpredictable.
Am I right?
