   I just installed Redhat 6.0. When i run "su" command it takes much
   time to apper passwd prompt.  Its also taking much time in
   authentication after entering the password.
This definitely seems like the classic "/etc/nsswitch.conf is told to
look for YP servers and you are not using YP", so have a look and fix
nsswitch.conf if this is in fact the problem.
