Hmm, that is strange. firmware_waking_vector seems to be all
zeros. How can that work?
struct acpi_table_facs {
        char signature[4];      /* ASCII table signature */
        u32 length;             /* Length of structure, in bytes */
        u32 hardware_signature; /* Hardware configuration signature */
        u32 firmware_waking_vector;     /* 32-bit physical address of
the Firmware Waking Vector */
...aha, firmware_waking_vector is to be filled by Linux, so I guess
this was false alarm.
