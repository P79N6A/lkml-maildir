had to change
KERN_WARN -> KERN_WARNING
then more errors
the patch never worked for me even when I had gotten it to work in
2.6.15.4, it never showed me what I wanted to see
drivers/scsi/libata-scsi.c: In function 'ata_gen_fixed_sense':
drivers/scsi/libata-scsi.c:638: error: 'ata_op' undeclared (first use in
this function)
drivers/scsi/libata-scsi.c:638: error: (Each undeclared identifier is
reported only once
drivers/scsi/libata-scsi.c:638: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [drivers/scsi/libata-scsi.o] Error 1
do you know who wrote the original patch?
