At least two bugs... there should be a prize for that :-)
Raid5 was definitely submitting a bio that was too big for the device,
and then when it got an error and went to try it the old-fashioned way
(lots of little Bi's through the stripe-cache) it messed up.
Whether that is what trigger the double-unlock I'm not yet sure.
This patch should fix the worst of the offences, but I'd like to
experiment and think a bit more before I submit it to stable.
And probably test it too - as yet I have only compile and brain
tested.
What is the chunk-size on your raid5?  Presumably at least 128k ?
