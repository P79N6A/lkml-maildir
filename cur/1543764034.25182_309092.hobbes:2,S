Subject: [03/08] fix ia64 syscall auditing

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
Attached is a patch against David's audit.17 kernel that adds checks
for the TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT thread flag to the ia64 system call and
signal handling code paths.  The patch enables auditing of system
calls set up via fsys_bubble_down, as well as ensuring that
audit_syscall_exit() is called on return from sigreturn.
Neglecting to check for TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT at these points results in
incorrect information in audit_context, causing frequent system panics
when system call auditing is enabled on an ia64 system.
I have tested this patch and have seen no problems with it.
