True.  But the plan is already to make bzImage an ELF file, so notes
would seem to be the best option.  At worst, it could be ELF notes
wrapped in some other container, but that's not pretty.

Yep.

Yeah, that's tricky.  I ended up copying the Xen pagetables's pmd into
the kernel's so that they could share ptes.  Making a completely new
pagetable means you need to update the RO state on both old and new.

Hm.  That's right.  Xen will boot a vmlinux with its pagetable
pre-constructed to map it at its virtual address.  Going through bzImage
would mean it would be identity mapped, and someone early would need to
construct the virtual mapping.
But if the path is:
   1. enter bzImage in 32-bit mode
   2. decompress kernel
   3. jump to startup_32
   4. detect paravirt and choose appropriate backend
   5. run Xen startup code
then the Xen startup code can construct the virtual mapping before going
on with the rest of the kernel boot - steps 1-4 can be run with identity
mapping.
