Interesting...  Dell DualPoint is the way the pointing devices are
described in that notebook's documentation, and I remember all the way
from back when I purchased the notebook: I really wanted the two
pointing devices.  If you search the web for Dell Inspiron 8000
DualPoint, you'll get a number of hits referring to `Dell's DualPoint
technology'.  I don't see them referred to as DualPoint(TM), but I
vaguely remember having seen something like that in Dell's web site
back then.
Maybe ALPS bought the trademark from Dell, or Dell hadn't actually
registered the trademark, or they somehow managed to get the
trademarks registered with a case difference (DualPoint vs Dualpoint)?

Indeed, it's called Dell DualPoint.  Sorry about the confusion.  Not
really my fault, I think :-) :-)
