Just because a patch has been signed does not mean it somehow manages
to bypass peer review.
If the patch is correct, it gets applied. If it's not obviously correct,
it gets reviewed by someone more familiar with the code.
Some people have a hard enough time getting patches they believe are
legitimate features/fixes past Al Viro, Dave Miller and the likes.
The chances of a trojan patch getting past them is I would hope, extremely minimal.
