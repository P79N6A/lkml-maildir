e_block is the block number; the e_indexes are hash values. Ext[23] only has 
32bit block numbers. Am I getting you wrong?

That would do as well.
A related issue:
Would switching to a more decent hash algorithm in fs/ext?/xattr.c make sense? 
I think there are better ones in 2.5. This would only degrade sharing on 
"legacy" systems for a while, but the slow down would vanish over time.
