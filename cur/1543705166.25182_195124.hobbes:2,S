Hello:
I'm getting this in dmesg with recent 2.6.2-rc2 and even with rc2-mm2 
and of course, I get no sound:
snd_intel8x0: Unknown symbol snd_mpu401_uart_new
so I must modprobe manually the mpu-401 driver. Is this the intended 
way? Or must mpu driver gets automounted? In other kernels I have not 
modprobed mpu-401 and the sound was working correctly.
Thanks a lot.
