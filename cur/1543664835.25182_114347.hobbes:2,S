I have 2 machines with eepro100 cards.  I used the original driver for
them out of habit and on the last 2.4.20 kernel get A LOT of:
eth0: freeing mc frame.
in my dmesg log.  Out of curiosity I tried with the alternate driver and
that seems to have gone away.  Is one depreciated or are they both
viable and just different?   The help message doesn't really say much on
the topic.
