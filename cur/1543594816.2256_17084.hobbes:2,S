I 've tested the User Mode Linux a few times ago, and it gave me an 
idea: given the fact that we had a GCC which
produce bytecode from C, it would be possible to produce a port of 
linux(a new directory "jvm" in the arch dir) which
would run in a Java Virtual Machine. (after some inquiries such compiler 
does not exist :-( )
I'm dreaming of a linux booting in a browser applet(imagine sending such 
thing in a mail to MS peoples !!!!)
