| I'd propose to remove the asmlinkage and to move the prototype (without 
| asmlinkage) back from syscalls.h to shm.h - what do you think?
It's not a syscall AFAICT.
It's not listed in any .S files, like most syscalls are.
However, it is listed in kernel/sys.c as a "cond_syscall",
which I'm guessing is incorrect.
I'd like to rename it so that it doesn't begin with "sys_".
