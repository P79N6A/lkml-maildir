What I meant is that it is already written and tested.

What kind of backdoor is it?  If you dlopen untrusted shared libraries
into your program you have far bigger problem than executable
stack (you can execute any code it wants in its constructors).
If there is a shared library which needs executable stack for its use
(on !IA64 !PPC64 this is e.g. any library which takes address of
a nested function and passes it to some other function and/or stores
it into some variable which cannot be optimized out, on IA64 or PPC64
this is of course much rarer, but it is still possible some language
interpreter or something builds code on the fly on the stack).
