	I can confirm that the last kernel this worked with was 2.6.6. We
can't get libusb working at all in 2.4 for the device detection (as you
know). I've now tried everything from 2.6.6 up to 2.6.7-rc2-mm2, including
all "official" (non-akpm) kernels in-between. Same issue.
	What I see in the logs, which may be of use, is:
May 31 21:38:08 wrath kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: suspend_hc
May 31 21:38:08 wrath kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: wakeup_hc
May 31 21:38:11 wrath kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: suspend_hc
May 31 21:38:11 wrath kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: wakeup_hc
May 31 21:38:13 wrath kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: suspend_hc
May 31 21:38:13 wrath kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: wakeup_hc
	..over and over and over, taking the system load gradually up, until
it no longer responds, and has to be rebooted forcibly.
