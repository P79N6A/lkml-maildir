Dear all,
I have a question about CM109 USB VoIP device.
Hope someone could told me how to treat it, many thanks first.
There are two CM109 chip VoIP phone device from different hardware vendor,
and they have the same vid/pid(0x0d8c/0x000e).
Now, here is the problem that key definition is different on them.
key matrix mapping is not the same between KomuniKate KIP1000
and Goodway AA2650.
How does the cm109.c distinguish two cm109 chip device except vid/pid?

On windows, most vendor ship their VoIP device with CD
that include key configuration utility.
So end user can easy set every key of VoIP device.
On Linux, should we create a VoIP driver interface to userland for
anyone wants to customize key definition? Then the CM109 driver can
focus report transmission on HID device. But this kind of interface
seems only hiddev interface supported, right?
