Hmm.. Send some faster hardware to Zwane then - I seem to recall
that his *faster* hardware was a 3-CPU 400mz box.
And then feel free to send faster hardware to everybody else on this
list who's not lucky enough to work for a company that will buy them
the latest-and-greatest.  For a lot of us, even a $700 consumer-class
machine is a major investment, and has to be balanced against things
like mortgages and food and keeping the car running so you can get to
your day job.....
