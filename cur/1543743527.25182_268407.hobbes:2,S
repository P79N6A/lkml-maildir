Subject: [RFC] [PATCH] [0/6] LSM Stacking
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/4/293

The following set of patches add support required to stack most
LSMs.  The most important patch is the first, which provides a
method for more than one LSM to annotate information to kernel
objects.  LSM's known to use the LSM fields include selinux, bsdjail,
seclvl, and digsig.  Without this patch (or something like it),
none of these modules can be used together.
The rest of the patches add stacking support to the existing LSMs.
Another set of three patches will be sent containing a stackable
version of bsdjail.
I have run some performance tests on a Fedora Core Devel system
under three configurations:
1. A 2.6.10-rc1-bk10 system with capabilities and SELinux compiled
into the kernel as it was in the default Fedora kernel.
2. A 2.6.10-rc1-bk10 system with the stacking patches, and capabilities
and SELinux compiled into the kernel under the stacker LSM.  Other
than stacker being compiled in and the size of the LSM void* array
being set to 4, the exact same .config was used.
3. The same kernel as in (2), but with bsdjail and seclvl also stacked.
On each of these configurations, I ran unixbench twice, and compiled
a kernel twice (with the same .config, and all files in the cached
each time).
The kernel compilation results are as follows:
         No stacking (1)           Stacking (2)      More Stacking (3)
