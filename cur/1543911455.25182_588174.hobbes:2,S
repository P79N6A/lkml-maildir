I would do it like this:
static int iphone_probe(struct usb_interface *intf,
			const struct usb_device_id *id)
{
	struct usb_device *udev = interface_to_usbdev(intf);
	int rc;
	if (udev->actconfig->desc.bConfigurationValue != 3) {
		dbg(&udev->dev, "Calling set_configuration\n");
		rc = usb_driver_set_configuration(udev, 3);
	} else {
		dbg(&udev->dev, "Configuration set, sending magic comand\n");
		rc = usb_control_msg(udev, usb_sndctrlpipe(udev, 0),
				0x40, (USB_DIR_OUT | USB_TYPE_VENDOR |
					USB_RECIP_DEVICE),
				0x6400, 0, NULL, 0, 1000);
	}
	if (rc)
		dev_err(&udev->dev, "Command failed: %d\n", rc);
	/* we don't really want to bind to the device, userspace programs can
	 * handle the syncing just fine, so get outta here. */
	return -ENODEV;
}
