Could you please explain about what "added restrictions" you're talking 
about? Let's actually look at the GPL, which states "You may not impose 
any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted 
herein.", a bit earlier we find "Activities other than copying, 
distribution and modification are not covered by this License".
So how exactly does EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL restrict you in these activities?
bye, Roman
