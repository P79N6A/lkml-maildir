Hi,
I tried 2.2.5-ac6 on our Alpha 21164A/PC164UX2 to solve a problem with
hwclock and xntpd (something with these 'ticks') but it won't boot. This
is what it says during boot (handmade faksimile):

In consequence the kernel is unable to mount the root partition (which
is on sda2).
Further info needed?
Any ideas?
Please reply to me since I am not on this list!!
