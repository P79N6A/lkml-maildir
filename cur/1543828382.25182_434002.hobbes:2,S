I really sorry, this is a patch to 2.6.16 and this kernel version works
well the speedtouch driver.
I have problems with 2.6.17 and the speedtocuh driver block the
conection at some point that  i can't locate.
wave:~# atmdiag
Itf       TX_okay   TX_err    RX_okay   RX_err    RX_drop
  0 AAL0         0         0         0         0         0
    AAL5    266537         0    198023         1         0
RX cells don't increment, AFAIK the driver don't manage incoming ATM cells
How i can dig more into this issue in order to extract  relevant
information for a bug report?.
Best Regards
Juampe.
