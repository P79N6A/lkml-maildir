That depends on the environment.  If it's already locked down via MAC
and rlimits, etc. and the bug now creates a DoS that wasn't there before
it may be important.  But, as a general rule of thumb, local DoS
is much less severe than other bugs, I fully agree.

Yes, me too.

Absolutely, yes.  Local root hole all too often == remote root hole.
