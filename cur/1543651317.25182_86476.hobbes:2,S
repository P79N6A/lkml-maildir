Ahha, it was the old qt-detection-problem.
make clean did not clean much:
make -f scripts/Makefile.clean obj=scripts/kconfig
*
* Unable to find the QT installation. Please make sure that the
* QT development package is correctly installed and the QTDIR
* environment variable is set to the correct location.

make[2]: *** [scripts/kconfig/.tmp_qtcheck] Error 1
make[1]: *** [scripts/kconfig] Error 2
make: *** [_clean_scripts] Error 2
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-swsusp$
make -i clean makes it properly kill all *.o.
