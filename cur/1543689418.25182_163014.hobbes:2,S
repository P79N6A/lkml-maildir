That's what fixup_bigphys_addr is for.  Basically, on the 440 the
first 4GB of physical address space is all RAM.  PCI memory space
occupies 2GB from 380000000 - 3ffffffff.  So if ioremap is given an
address between 2GB and 4GB, it is assumed to be from a PCI driver,
and fixup_bigphys_addr adds on the 0x300000000.

drivers/net/ibm_emac/ibm_ocp_enet.c in 2.4 does - it's an ocp driver,
not a pci driver.  Yes, we owe Jeff Garzik a 2.5 version of that
driver.
