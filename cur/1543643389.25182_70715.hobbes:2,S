   While reading about IP options, I found the IPOPT_END padding (cleaning)
   in ip_options_compile (net/ipv4/ip_options.c) was not incrementing a
   pointer.  There should be an optptr++ in the for end-of-block statement
   to go along with the l--, otherwise it's just comparing the same byte
   for each l.  Patch is against 2.4.19.  From the kernel source browser
   this bug is also in 2.5.31, 2.2.21, and 2.0.39.
Thanks a lot for spotting this, I will add this
to my 2.4.x and 2.5.x trees and merge upstream.
