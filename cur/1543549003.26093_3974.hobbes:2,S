Has anyone else tried 240-test9-pre2 on low-memory systems?
I compiled 240t9p2, bzlilo'ed it, and rebooted.  During
boot it tripped up on e2fsck -- it was at maximum mount count
and it stopped during the check.
Once I got past the check, and was able to get it to a prompt.
I tried to compile the kernel modules.  Once again, it stopped
during the compile of the first file (either loop.c or floppy.c).
By "stopped", I mean the _program_ acted as though it had hung.
The system didnt hang, I was able to ctrl-c out of it, and there
was no oops or panic.    It doesnt seem to be able to run any
substantial program w/o stopping.
Previous kernel was 240-test8, no problems there.
