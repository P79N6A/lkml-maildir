Subject: [PATCH] teach checkpatch.pl about list_for_each

Hi Andy,
you seem to be the last person messing around with checkpatch.pl so I'm
addressing this to you. :-)
checkpatch complains about the following:
WARNING: no space between function name and open parenthesis '('
#520: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_s3c24xx_dma.c:478:
+       list_for_each_entry (transfer, &message->transfers, transfer_list) {
which I think is a bit bogus since it actually is a for statement in
disguise.  The following patch adds list_for_each to the list of things
that look like functions that it shouldn't complain about.
By the way, what is the consensus on lines over 80 characters?
checkpatch complains about the following:
WARNING: line over 80 characters
#762: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_s3c24xx_dma.c:720:
+       printk(KERN_INFO "S3C24xx SPI DMA driver (c) 2007 Nordnav Technologies AB\n");
I can of course break this into:
        printk(KERN_INFO "S3C24xx SPI DMA driver (c) 2007 Nordnav "
	       "Technologies AB\n");
but in my opinion that becomes more even unreadable.  Would it be
possible to add a special case so that checkpatch ignores long strings
that go beyond 80 characters?  Do you think it is a good idea?
