Just FYI:  Al was very opposed to the idea of passing the vfsmount to
the vfs_ helpers, so you should discuss this with him.
Looking at the actual patches I see you're lazy in a lot of places.
Please make sure that when you introduce a vfsmount argument somewhere
that it is _always_ passed and not just when it's conveniant.  Yes, that's
more work, but then again if you're not consistant anyone half-serious
will laught at a security model using this infrasturcture.
