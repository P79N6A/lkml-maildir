	2.6.0 has the latest stable version (as version 0.14 is still
beta). David may want to comment on his plans.

	Javier has done a great job, cf. fixes in 2.6.0-final.

	Todo. Atmel Pcmcia done. The release of 2.6.0 will help get
maintainer motivated ;-)

	Done. The Atmel wireless driver in the kernel is using the new
firmware loading infrastructure (as well as other drivers), and distro
are picking up firmare.agent hotplug script.

	Please report those bugs to the driver authors with precise
details of setup and issue. Such useless bug report should not be in a

	I'll probably send you stuff for 2.6.1 when I'll be back from
the hollyday break.
	Have fun...
