Sounds similar to cat /proc/cpuinfo.  How *do* we deal with processors
which have all these many different features?  Probably better than we
would if each variant were viewed as a different architecture.
Jeff's approach taken to the rediculous would mean that we'd have
ext versions 1-40 by now at least.  I don't think that helps much,
either.
I think the ext2/3 team has done a great job of providing compatibility.
It isn't perfect compatibility forwards *and* backwards, but moving
forwards always seems to be pretty reasonable.
