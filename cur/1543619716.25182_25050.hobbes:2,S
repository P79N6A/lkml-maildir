Agreed, I suspect you do indeed have a problem.
What is the output of `/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail' when
programs are stalled?  Is it actually 0?
Can you see if any programs are perhaps draining entropy in the
background?  See what has /dev/[u]random open ... note even /dev/urandom
uses entropy, its the same as /dev/random, except it doesn't care when
the entropy estimate is 0.
