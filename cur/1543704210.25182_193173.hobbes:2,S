Hi !
Time for a big PowerMac merge, a bunch of these things are driver
updates and machine support fixes that went in after the 2.6.0-rc
code freeze, and support for newer machines (including 32 bits support
for the G5).
This is for inclusion with -mm and possible comments, currently, the 51
changesets are folded in one big patch. When it's time to merge with
linus, he'll get them as separate csets.
The full support for the G5 also need a sungem driver update currently
in davem's hands.
The full support for all recent pmacs also wants some fbdev updates that
will come separately.
Too big to be posted here (and I didn't feel like using Greg's script to
post 51 emails in burst to lkml :) so here's an URL to pick it up:
