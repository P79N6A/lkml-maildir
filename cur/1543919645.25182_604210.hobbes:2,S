But there was nothing about trust. Usually you don't trust somebody
but somebody's opinions. The problem is there was no valid opinion,

So, you think this would be the first or the least credibly
verified undocumented feature used in linux? Then, it seems

And, I can trust you, it will not break anything...?)
