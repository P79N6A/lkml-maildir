I handle thousands of emails a day, over a hundred emails distinctly to 
me, not a list.  I like mozilla most, but don't think I like the 
footprint or everything about it ;)

As I mentioned to DJ, this is fine for you, your personal database, but 
it serves no purpose for anyone else and doesn't scale well for large 
amounts of reference material.

Untidied bug reports can be flushed out of the system, they can be 
<insert action>.  By making a more intuitive system, these bug reports 
could be fleshed out better or coallated when appropriate.  By having an 
open system, anyone can do the maintenance.  You can choose different 
pools for the entries and keep the chaff "outside" until it is weeded 
through or discarded.

Not everything needs to be documented or documented in detail. 
 Sometimes a simple "loopback compile err, 'loopback.c:417:foo is not 
defined' is fixed in 2.2.2." is quite sufficient.  People with 2.2.1 
will recognize the need to upgrade or generate a patch to solve their 
problem.  The FAQ doesn't address everything and not everything is 
broken.  A 'bug' database is sometimes a misnomer.
Neither the DB nor the list replace each other.  They augment each other.
