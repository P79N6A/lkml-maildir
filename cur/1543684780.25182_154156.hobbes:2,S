Try replacing the tg3 driver with the one found in newer kernels (2.4.22pre
or 2.4.21) or make sure you are using the latest RH kernel with the updated
tg3 driver.  Do not use the bcm5700.o driver BTW, it has problems.
Another problem could be the aacraid controller, but they normally have a
lot of noise associated with a hang.  Unfortunately it's unclear at this
time if that is a hardware problem, firmware problem, or driver problem.
