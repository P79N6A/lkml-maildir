I would suspect the Ascend Pipeline.  I'm connected through PPP to an
Ascend MAX 4048, and used to experience TCP checksum errors.  Someone
(see below) suggested turning off VanJacobsen compression on my PPP
link, and that seemed to do the trick.  I haven't seen any checksum
errors since.  Just add the 'novj' option to your PPP config files, and
redial.

I'm running kernel 2.1.131.
