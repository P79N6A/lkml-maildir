Subject: [PATCH 2/3] tracepoints: Include only minimal RCU headers in linux/tracepoint.h.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/28/124

This allows kmemtrace to work nicely with tracepoints, since RCU headers
don't end up anymore including SLAB headers. It might also speed up
compilation because there's less preprocessing involved.
