Hi Dan,
I think that is not 64-bit portability bug and the code should be
reviewed by Lew Glendenning (who wrote it). I'm sending a copy of
the message to Lew and hope he'll check the code ;)
P.S. (for Lew)
	Lew, I think window->phys in esb2rom_init_one() remains in zero
	and then sets it to 0xffffffffffc00000 after 
		window->phys -= 0x400000UL
	May be something wrong with word returned at pci_read_config_word()?
		Cyrill
