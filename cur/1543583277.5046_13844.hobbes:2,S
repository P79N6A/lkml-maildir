It would also be good to share parts of the infrastructure
between the different clustering architectures ...

I know each of the cluster projects have mailing lists, but
I've never heard of a list where the different projects come
together to eg. find out which parts of the infrastructure
they could share, or ...
Since I agree with you that we need such a place, I've just
created a mailing list:
	linux-cluster@nl.linux.org
To subscribe to the list, send an email with the text
"subscribe linux-cluster" to:
	majordomo@nl.linux.org
I hope that we'll be able to split out some infrastructure
stuff from the different cluster projects and we'll be able
to put cluster support into the kernel in such a way that
we won't have to make the choice which of the N+1 cluster
projects should make it into the kernel...
regards,
Rik
