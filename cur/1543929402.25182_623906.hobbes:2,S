Are there any options? This reminds me of Emulex lpfc driver that by default
would retry forever but could be configured to fail request after timeout.

Well, FAILFAST is really needed only for redundant configuration (either
multipath or RAID). But in this case what is the point of retrying request
at all? It just complicates implementation.
Just fail request as soon as possible and let upper layer to recover.
