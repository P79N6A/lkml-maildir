Why ?
If isa detection failed, the modules could not find any new isa devices.
If the pnp detection find no device, the module is load.
If it is the kernel modules behaviour, lot's of modules are broken...
If you want that, why not simply alway "return 0" in the __init like it 
is done in the bugzilla patch ?
