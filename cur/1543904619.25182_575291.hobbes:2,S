That's true. Its not mainline. We had similar discussion in the past
also. I think we should allow only audited code to be run after panic().
Leaving it open to modules or unaudited code makes this solution
something like LKCD where whole lot of code used to run after the crash,
hence was unreliable.
If KDB goes mainline, then I think it is not a bad idea to call debugger
first (if it is enabled) and then one can trigger crash dump from inside
the debugger.
