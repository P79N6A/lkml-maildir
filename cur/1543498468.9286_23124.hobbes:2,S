I'm running 2.0.36, and just got the following error message
echoed to my screen:
Jun  9 19:23:43 asdf kernel: Sound error: Couldn't allocate DMA buffer
What gives?  I have heard of such problems but up until now, I
have not experienced any.
This is the 2.0.36 kernel.  What is the workaround/fix/whatever?
Is there a way to have the kernel allocate a DMA buffer
permanently for the sound card?  I'd rather give up 64k of memory
to the sound card than have it not work.
How is it done?
Thanks in advance.
TTYL
