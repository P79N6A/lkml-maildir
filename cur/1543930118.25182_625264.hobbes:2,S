Based on what's in that commit, it *does* appear something went wrong
with bisection.  If the implicated commit is the next one in time
sequence relative to
# good: [2f1f53bdc6531696934f6ee7bbdfa2ab4f4f62a3] CRISv10 fasttimer: Scrap INLINE and name timeval_cmp better
then the test of whether I bisected correctly is as simple as applying
the commit and seeing if things break, because I'm running on the
kernel corresponding to 2f1f53bdc6531696934f6ee7bbdfa2ab4f4f62a3 right
now.  Let me give that a try and I'll report back.  Worst case, I'll
have to start over and write off the past four days...
Sorry about this...
