In a NUMA situation we have a choice between 
1. Allocating a page from the local node (which consumes more memory and 
is advantageous performance wise.
2. Not allocating from the local node but see if any other node has 
   available partially allocated slabs. If we allocate from them then
   we save memory and reduce the amount of partial slabs on the remote 
   node. Thus the fragmentation ratio is reduced.

That is not what this is about. And the functionality has been in SLUB 
since the beginning.
