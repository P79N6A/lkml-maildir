Yes for lguest, that is a linux-only ground for play and research and
that will most likely not change in near future.
It is complete bullshit for kvm.  You can run almost anything as guest
in kvm, and I certainly wouldn't be surprised if we see other operating
systems start using the kvm paravirt interface.

We'll certainly need some stable ABI for kvm too, so you can mix kernel
versions on host and guest.  I really can't see why do you think kvm is
special in any way (except that it is your favorite toy at the moment).

Fine, so lets move kvm paravirtualitzation into vmi too (proof of
concept code by Anthony Liguori exists) and kill one more item on the
(linux) QA test matrix?  (just following your arguments, not that I'm
confident it would actually help reducing QA effort).
