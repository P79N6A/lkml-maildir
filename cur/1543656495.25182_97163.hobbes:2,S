err, now hang on.
I thought you said that this simple dd sometimes takes 14 seconds, 
and sometimes takes 4 minutes.
Please describe _exactly_ what activity is happening, and against
what disks when this problem exhibits.  The "other jobs".

Doubtful.  As far as reiserfs (and the block layer) is concerned,
your raid array is just a single disk (is this correct??)

Try a different filesystem
Try a dd to the blockdevice itself (or cat /dev/zero > /dev/sda1)
Run `vmstat 1' and send us the output which corresponds to
the poor throughput.
Try a different RAID mode.
Pull some disks out.
