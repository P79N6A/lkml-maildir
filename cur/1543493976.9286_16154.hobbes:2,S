You need the ibcs-2.0-* for 2.0 kernels and ibcs-2.1-* for 2.1
and later kernels. If you think you have the right one then
either you don't have any kernel headers or the ones that you
have got are not for the kernel you thought.

Uh, it's in a sub-directory whose name I don't appear to have
at work. I think it's either ibcs or linux. Failing that try
asking David Bruce <admin@hulcote.com>.
