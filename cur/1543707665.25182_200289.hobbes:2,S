Yes, a few of them.
Ordinarily, userland software uses pathnames in /dev.
But some software knows too much.
In dietlibc-0.20 one can read:
char *ttyname(int fd) {
...
  if (S_ISCHR(s.st_mode)) {
    n=minor(s.st_rdev);
    switch (major(s.st_rdev)) {
    case 4:
...
    case 2:
...
    case 136:
    case 137:
    case 138:
    case 139:
...
}
This code knows about the actual values of majors.
There are lots of examples like this.
For stable use of Linux one must preserve the 16-bit legacy area.
On the other hand, if the goal is to find and eradicate all such
ugly uses of explicit device numbers, Linus' idea to make it all
random will certainly help.
(But a big grep for st_rdev might be more efficient.)
