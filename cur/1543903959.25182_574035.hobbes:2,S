My intent was to allow userspace to establish assign a virtual address
range into a memory slot.
So long as you don't do swapping, all is simple, since you can do a
get_user_pages() on initialization or when installing a shadow pte.  But
if you want to swap, you need:
- a way to transfer the dirty bit from the shadow ptes to the struct page
- a way to let the vm rmap know that there are shadow ptes that point to
the page in addition to Linux ptes.  These shadow ptes may be in a
different format than Linux ptes.
- a different tlb invalidation method with ASIDs
It's not going to be simple.
