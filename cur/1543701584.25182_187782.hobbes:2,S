Hi,
I have a device called an IT8212 IDE RAID controller. It comes with a Linux 
2.4 driver which emulates a SCSI interface and supports both JBOD and 
hardware RAID (0 and 1) modes of operation.
I don't quite understand the relationship between drivers/ide/... and RAID 
support. Why for example, would the existing driver be written as a SCSI 
driver and not an IDE driver?
Thanks, Shaheed
