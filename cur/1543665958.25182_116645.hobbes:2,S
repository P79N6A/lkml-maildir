This is why changesets need to be first-class objects in the repository,
that can be versioned, segmented and recombined.  I'd be able to pull 
slightly differing changesets from a variety of sources, *merge
the changesets* and carry the result forward in my repository.  This
way, no changeset needs to lose its identity until I explicity want it
to.
