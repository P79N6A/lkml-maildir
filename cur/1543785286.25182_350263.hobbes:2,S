Or rather use epoll instead of poll/select to avoid scalability issues.

The refcounting is already implemented for FDs and will be kept
working 100% of the time because if it failed the kernel would not
even boot for most people due to initscripts leaking massive memory at
exit time. Not that GFS will not be maintained, but the
kernel-at-large has more people behind it.

Perhaps persistent locks could be registered with a daemon by passing
them via unix pipes.
