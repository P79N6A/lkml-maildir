All of which indicates that if we can remove the down_write(mmap_sem) from
this glibc operation, things should get a lot better - there will be no
additional context switches at all.
And we can surely do that if all we're doing is looking up pageframes,
putting pages into fake-swapcache and moving them around on the page LRUs.
Hugh?  Sanity check?
That difference between the 2-way and the 8-way sure is odd.
