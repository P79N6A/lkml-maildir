Hi Kim-san
Do you adjust hackbench parameter?
my parameter adjust my test machine(8GB mem),
if unchanged, maybe doesn't works it because lack memory.

Hm
I don't have embedded test machine.
but I can desktop.
I will test it about weekend.
if you don't mind, could you please send me .config file
and tell me your test kernel version?
Thanks, interesting report.

reclaim conflict rarely happened on UP.
thus, my patch expect no improvement.
but (of course) I will fix regression.

sorry, I inserted debug code to my patch at that time.
