I was not successfull at testing it last night, even locally built versions of 
roadnav are segfaulting for me now.  Something still missing from the wxGTK 
camp I believe.
Feb 21 21:05:49 coyote kernel: [799800.925900] roadnav[30556]: segfault at 
00000041 eip 494b9d2f esp bf9d8570 error 4
But that may was well be swahili to me.  And it may run half an hour before it 
does it.  It seems to be related to trying to pull missing TIGER-line maps.  
Its also a serious cpu hog when its running.
