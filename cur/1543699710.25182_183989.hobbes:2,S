Did you compile in read-write support?
What is the message in syslog when NTFS loads? If it is a module then type
"modprobe ntfs" to make sure it is loaded.  If not a module or a module
and you have loaded it just type: dmesg | grep -i ntfs and please tell me
the output you get from that.
Also, note that writes to resident files are not permanent in the driver
in 2.6-test11 (i.e. small files about 500 bytes or so).  They are never
written to disk.  Bigger files >1kb are guaranteed to be written always.
Best regards,
	Anton
