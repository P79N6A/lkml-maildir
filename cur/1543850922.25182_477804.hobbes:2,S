Unfortunately, this has always happened since kernel 2.4 from years
back, even with USB1 devices and I had to drop software raid 0.
As far as I understand the quirk code, it's not enabled for the VT8233
southbridge.
I can add the PCI ID of this VT8233 for this quirk code, if it's
compatible, and do some crash tests. Crashes are usually easy to
produce and not hardware destructive since I got plenty of them. But
you may want to proceed in another way.
