Agreed...  The topology macros are designed to work for *any* 
architecture, so there's no need to selectively include them.

Looking over the code... I think I agree with Christoph here.  I think 
that most of the new code won't even get touched in the non-NUMA case. 
Of course, let me know if I'm wrong! ;)

Actually, the non-double-underbar versions are not in the kernel...  I 
have a patch for them, though...  They just do some simple bound/error 
checking as wrappers around the double-underbar versions.  As long as 
you aren't calling the macros with bizarre values (ie 0<=i<=NR_CPUS), 
the double-underbar versions will work just fine, and will be mildly 
quicker.
Other than that, it looks good to me!
Cheers!
