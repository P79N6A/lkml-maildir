This is definitely an important goal.  But lock-metering code in a fully
preemptible kernel an also identify spots where algorithmic improvements
are most important.

Spinlocks should not be held for lots of time.  This adversely affects
SMP scalability as well as latency.  That's why MontaVista's kernel
preemption patch uses sleeping mutex locks instead of spinlocks for the
long held locks.  In a fully preemptible kernel that is implemented
correctly, you won't find any hard-coded calls to the scheduler in time
consuming code.  The scheduler should only be called in response to an
interrupt (IO or timeout) when we know that a higher priority process
has been made runnable, or when the running process sleeps (voluntarily
or when it has to wait for something) or exits.  This is the case in
both of the fully preemptible kernels which I've worked on (IRIX and
REAL/IX).
