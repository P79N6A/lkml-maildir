i don't really buy that it can't be done or you complex patches are
necessary to be honest --- and there are various alternative APIs that
could help as others have pointed out
could you perhaps explain some *real* *world* applications/systems
where this is necessary and why existing APIs won't work with them
perhaps?
solving a real-world problem is much more interesting to listen to
that filling in a check-box on a (somewhat dubious) specification
