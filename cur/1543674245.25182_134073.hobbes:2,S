x86-64 has this, (pagefault_trace), but it's usually hidden in a debug
CONFIG and not too useful in normal operation (because it generates too
much output), so I didn't port this. At one point I also did a sysctl
to echo a string into and strcmp the process ->comm against this, 
but it was a bit ugly so I removed it again.

Probably, but that's not the intention of this patch. From my
experience page fault tracing is too much for printk because it
produces too much information. It needs some specialized logging
module that is optimized for high frequency logging like SGI ktrace.
It could be surely implemented, but I didn't plan to do this work
currently. If you wanted it I would suggest considering kprobes or dprobes
instead which allows to define logging macros for such things nicely already.

I especially like it being a global option. It has catched bugs on x86-64 
that were never noticed before (e.g. subprocesses silently segfaulting 
that nobody noticed doing the same on i386). Clearly it's an debugging 
thing and you definitely want an option to turn it off. But having 
the global option is useful.
Also programs that break with this are much less frequent than you
probably think.
