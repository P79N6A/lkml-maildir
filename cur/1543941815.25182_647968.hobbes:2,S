Hi everybody,
>Over two years ago, the Linux USB developers stated that they believed
>there was no way to create a USB kernel driver that was not under the

>There are no known closed source USB drivers in the wild, so this patch

hm, I'm not sure, but will your patch make Samsung's Unified Linux
Driver for printing & scanning stop working?

another Manufacturer / Candidate I'm worrying about is Brother:

Brother is providing opensource cups drivers (kudos to the developers
@ Brother for that!), the sane-drivers however seem to be closed
source, will those work ?
I'm no developer, just a heavy user ;) so unfortunately I can't tell
whether those drivers are dependent on being NOT GPL,
if your patch will find its inclusion into Linus' mainline-tree,
there's still the possibility to revert that patch, right ? (freedom
of doing with the code what I need to)
Many thanks in advance & thanks a lot for your work :)
