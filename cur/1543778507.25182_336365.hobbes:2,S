Sigh, sorry.  It's hard.  -mm is always in flux.  I no longer send out the
`patch was dropped' message because it disturbs people.  The mm-commits
list does not resend a patch when it is changed (other patches folded into
it, rejects fixed, changelog updated, rediffed, etc).  Sometimes I'll
comment out a patch but not fully drop it.  I pull all the git trees at
least twice a day and that's not reflected on the mm-commits list either.
You can always tell when a -mm release is coming by watching the shower of
stupid compile fixes emerging :(
I spose I could emit a broken-out.tar.gz file occasionally (it'd be up to 5
times a day), but there's no guarantee that it'll compile, let alone run. 
I could also send a notification to mm-commits when I do so.  Would that
help?
