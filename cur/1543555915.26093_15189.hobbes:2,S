I will have to acquire another suitable disk to reproduce this problem
using an unmodified tree.  If anyone can help, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks
in advance.  If not, I'll try to reproduce it when I can get the hardware.
For what its worth, on my single processor home machine, all kernels
2.4.0-test11-ac1,ac2,ac3, ac4 both UP and SMP run both Gnome and
KDE 2.0, with reiserfs-3.6.19.  In other words, everything works with
everything.
