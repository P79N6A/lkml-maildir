Gentlemen,
I have a Sony Vaio PCG-FX215 and use via82cxxx_audio and ac97_codec as
modules to drive the sound.  With all kernel versions I can play 8-bit
ISDN u-law files.  With 2.4.5 and earlier (back to 2.2.19presomething at
least) I could play MP3s.  With 2.4.6 and later I get a "No supported rate
found!" message from mpg123 (version 0.59q).  The particular MP3 is
encoded at 128 kbit/s, 44100 Hz joint stereo.
Regards,
- Greg
