If I understand you correctly, you only want to be notified if any
memory within an allocation is used before any memory within the
allocation has been initialized. I think that this would be quite
useless compared to tracking all the bytes of an allocation. I am not
truly concerned about the memory usage; this kind of error detection
is by definition slow and memory intense. I think that slab poisoning
is in a way more subtle, since it does not immediately produce a
warning on its own; what it does is really to invoke *other* error
catching mechanisms. Slab poisoning works best with pointers since
pointers will be dereferenced. What about other kinds of data? The
kernel will not complain (loudly enough, anyway) if your bit-field
contains some arbitrary unexpected value. Kmemcheck will immediately
print a message to the log in this case.

Yep, I didn't realize. Thanks. :-)
