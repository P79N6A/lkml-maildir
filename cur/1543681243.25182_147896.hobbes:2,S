I happily run 2.4.21-pre5 with ACPI enabled and everything works just 
fine. I tried today 2.6-pre1 with exactly the same hardware 
configuration as the 2.4 one and the laptop does not boot. It hangs 
while dispaying : "Executing all Devices _STA and_INIT methods" 
allthough it has already printed several '.'
