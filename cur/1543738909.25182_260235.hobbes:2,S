At first, that patch it is not essential to no-bitmap-buddy patch, and removing
it is okay. It seems that test and discussion are not enough now.
Since I heared that all of the pages in a granule on ia64 are guaranteed to exist,
I included that in no-bitmap-buddy-patch.
(when pagesize=16k/granule=16M,I think this has no effect.)
My purpose was to reduce # of page fault when ia64_pfn_valid() is called.
It is called heavily in bad_range() (in mm/page_alloc.c) now.
