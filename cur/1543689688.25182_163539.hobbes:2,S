We are doing this as defensive programming (because of bogus device
drivers, for example), like the other idle routines (default_idle, and
poll_idle) always do. 
BTW, I'm not sure that local_irq_disable() is really required below (as
you know, "sti" is hiding in safe_halt()).
void default_idle(void)
{
	if (!hlt_counter && current_cpu_data.hlt_works_ok) {
=>		local_irq_disable();
		if (!need_resched())
			safe_halt();
		else
			local_irq_enable();
	}
}
Thanks,
Jun
