Well, yes, of course we do.  We're a sofware tlb arch, so we generate
exceptions on tlb misses, which can occur anywhere (even in critical
sections).  However, the exceptions are carefully crafted not to take
spinlocks, so everything should be safe.
I'm not sure about the no in irq assertion.  The biggest use of
flush_dcache_page is on the I/O return path ... that looks like a good
candidate for being in interrupt (even though most drivers should be
offloading to softirq/tasklets).
