Unfortunatelly it's not possible. Joe average will not even try "development"
kernel and some errors could not be found without A LOT OF users.

Huh. And why redhat/debian so struggle for "reproducible builds" (unlike
Slackware :-) ? This is way it's trivial to recreate new binary package when
needed with just `rpm --rebuild` (or whatever in Debian?). Of course it's not
only goal but `rpm --rebuild` is there for purpose !

Looks like few overlooked problems in 2.0.x kernels started all this fuzz :-((
Even NT where binary compatibility is fetish doing it (after NT 4.0 and
NT 4.0 SP3 are not 100% binary-compatible!) why you thing Linux is exception ?

Or they will outsource "stuff like this" or stuff will be thrown out in dust
and OSS replacement will be done eventually (even if this will not happens
this year or next year :-) We here have simple rule: "no software in kernel
mode or under user root on servers without available sources" and I think that
this trend will be expanding in the future. [VERY] Slowly but inevitable...

Why you think so ? IMO "no drivers" or "no AFS support" or "no USB support"
is WAY better then "binary-only drivers", "AFS support via binary-module"
and "USB with precompiled kernel blob".
