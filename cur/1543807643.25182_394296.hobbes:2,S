It would more be an ever-changing interface that would drive them crazy. So 
why don't we come up with an agreed method of starting a suspend and 
starting a resume that they can use, without worrying about whether 
they're getting swsusp, uswsusp or Suspend2? /sys/power/state seems the 
obvious choice for this. An additional /sys entry could perhaps be used to 
modify which implementation is used when you echo disk > /sys/power/state 
- something like
# cat /sys/power/disk_method
swsusp uswsusp suspend2
# echo uswsusp > /sys/power/disk_method
# echo > /sys/power/state
Is there a big problem with that, which I've missed?
Regards,
Nigel
