Hello Julian,
when I decided to write the patch I had to solve following problem:
LINUX with shaper devices and proxy arp   ----    WIN clients (which couldn't
start up).
I tried to solve problem with simple trick (like disable proxy arp or change
routing info), but I couldn't. Then, I realized that the problem was at
"kernel" level, cause I had:
host           interface
HOST1      shaper0 (eth0)
So, when HOST1 started up, kernel (wrongly) sent it an ARP REPLY cause source
interface was different from destination interface (for the host). This is
really wrong, I think, cause shaper0 is the SAME interface (at physical
level, where proxy arp works) of eth0 (it uses same first 2 level ISO/OSI,
shaper has to be managed exactly as eth0).
In the end I say that I prefer kernel mode solution, rather than use mode
solution.
I Hope to has been clear.
Let me know what you think.
Regards
Roberto Arcomano
