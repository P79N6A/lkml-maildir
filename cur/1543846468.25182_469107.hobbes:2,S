I'm answering away from the code (limited Internet access) so I'll
have to look better some things. The patch has been merged, I'll care
for that in any case (avoiding conflicts with my changes as needed).

Ah, ok. I fixed exactly this - now ubd_open_dev and ubd_close_dev are
called only through ubd_{get,put}_dev, which manage the refcount. I
did this also for other reasons - the refcount makes "close while it
is being used" impossible, so solves "mutual exclusion without
locking" (like the network layer state machine does for network
devices, this is used in general for fds; I'll write something about
this).

I know ubd_file_size doesn't require opening, I thought (and still
think) that call was for error checking. I'll have to re-read the
code now that I saw your point.

Well, this may simplify locking, so it may be interesting - I'll see.

Ok, but the one I saw exists (in the error: label), (but I have the
patch for it).
