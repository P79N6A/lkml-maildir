Subject: [PATCH] reiserfs: fix deadlock in inode creation failure path w/ default ACL
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/18/85

 reiserfs_new_inode() can call iput() with the xattr lock held. This will
 cause a deadlock to occur when reiserfs_delete_xattrs() is called to
 clean up.
 The following patch releases the lock and reacquires it after the iput. This
 is safe because interaction with xattrs is complete, and the relock is just
 to balance out the release in the caller.
 The locking needs some reworking to be more sane, but that's more intrusive
 and I was just looking to fix this bug.
