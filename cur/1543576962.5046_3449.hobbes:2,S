i know that you've said previously that you've increased your MTU beyond 
1500, but can you validate that it is actually working?
ie. ping something on the other side of the GRE tunnel using a ping with 
total packet sizes equal to 1500?
alternatively, ensure that your application is capable of enforcing a MSS 
<1460 if this is shown to not be the case ..
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/105/56.html
 contains some good information 
on some of the potential pitfalls of using tunnels.
cheers,
lincoln.
