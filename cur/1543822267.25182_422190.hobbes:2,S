Yes, except it's not trivially done because if __cli was an inline
function, you need to have everything that is used in the declaration
defined when the function is declared as opposed to when the #define
gets used.  I'll give it another try, but it very quickly becomes
#include hell.
Anybody want to comment on the performance impact of making
local_irq_* non-inline functions?
