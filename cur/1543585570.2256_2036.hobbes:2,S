My choice would have been (A) if there was a nice way to create small
filesystems at the time I did binfmt_misc. This is also the reason I
dont like your rewrite - it does the same sucky kludges, but with an
own filesystem that could do a lot better - _and_ it breaks
backward compatibility wrt mounting. Doh - I thought you could do
better.

The first version was w/o /proc support but used sysctl and a userspace
program. But well, people wantet /proc and /proc was sexy, everything
was done using /proc, so I did use it, too. Bad decision - I should have
started rewriting the fs layer at that time...
