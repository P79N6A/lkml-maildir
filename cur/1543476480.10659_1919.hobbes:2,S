I have to disagree here.  Overloading `new' and `delete' per object
type, with a good allocator (e.g., the kernel's slab allocator) can
result in *excellent* memory allocation performance.  One obvious thing
is that the choice of allocator, bucket etc. can be resolved at compile
time.  That is enough to make many allocation & free calls just a few
inline instructions, with occasional out of line calls.  It is very
fast, and for some allocation patterns very memory efficient.
Of course, the kernel already does this for the critical structures, so
there's no need for C++.

Unless you're a real C++ expert.  Sometimes it can make the code
thinner, by dint of clever type inference, and clever compile-time
transformations with templates.  I admit this is rare and difficult.

I disagree.  The kernel does many things that would naturally get
expressed in C++ as objects -- especially the function pointer stuff,
and some of the unions.  However the existing C mechanisms are in some
cases faster than they would be in C++.

I've seen the required design discipline.  It said "no" to C++...

When that happens, it'll probably outstrip the demand for a kernel, too.
