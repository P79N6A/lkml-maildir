You might want to stop and take a look at the way this works on i386
before you argue with Ulrich any more about it.
Specifically, the vsyscall DSO is constructed as a normal ELF image,
and its base address is passed to glibc as an AT_SYSINFO tag in the
application's auxv vector.  Glibc source code has absolutely no
knowledge of the base address, which in fact has changed at least three
times since it was created.
