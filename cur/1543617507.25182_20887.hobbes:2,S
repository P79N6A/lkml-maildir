	btw, i've heard there was a trick to enable automatic reboot of apple 
powermac after a power failure (broken link on www.penguinppc.org, I've even 
asked webmasters whithout having any response)
	My main server/gateway/firewall _is_ a PPC running linux, and I would damn 
like to know this trick !
thanx for any pointer/answer/whatever..
