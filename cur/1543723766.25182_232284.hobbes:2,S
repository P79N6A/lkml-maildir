Hi Andrew,
with 2.6.7-mm6 cpu hotplug for s390 miraculously works again.
Not that I'm complaining but it's a bit strange. Oh well, here is
another update: 2 bug fix patches, 1 cleanup and 2 new features.
The patches are against -mm6, the cpu hotplug patch has one reject
if it is applied against -bk.
1) common i/o layer bug fix
2) dasd device driver bug fix
3) use debug feature in ctc driver
4) cpu hotplug support
5) cpu idle notifier
blue skies,
  Martin.
