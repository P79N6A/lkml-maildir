To be somewhat more precise, writing is only supported as far as copying is
concerned. And yes, cdrdao (CDR disk at once) can copy VCD format. If anyone
knows of a pssibility to master a VCD, please let me know!
I would very much like to toast some MPEG-I movies I have got to a VCD which
would also enable standalone VCD players to play them without the need for a
computer beeing turned on (OK actually the VCD player is a computer ;) but I
guess you know what I mean).
