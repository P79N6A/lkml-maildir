Sure it does.
You live in a theoretical world where
 (a) there is only one standard
 (b) people read it
 (c) people actually follow it and never have bugs
I've got news for you: none of the above is true. 
Which means that IN PRACTICE you will find strings that you think are 
UTF-8-encoded, but that don't end up being proper UTF-8.
That's the difference between real world and theory. 
And you can either write your programs to be "theoretically correct", or 
you can write them to "work".
It's your choice. I know which program I'd prefer to use.
