it was an intel LX chipset
that it is a memory problem i also don't belive. that ram work for over 2 year
with no errors found with memtest (memtset86, intels memtest) compiling
seveal times xfree86 and an many many times several kernels. 
and i never had any problems. until i tried the first time a 2.4.x kernel on 
the fileserver (that was 2.4.6). so i moved the fileserver back to 2.2.19.
