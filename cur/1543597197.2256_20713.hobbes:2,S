Hello folks,
I'm having trouble identifying wether I'm having hardware or software(
OS ) problems.  For the past couple of Months I've been having system
lockups every 10 days or so.
I suspect that it is a problem with the Adaptec 39160 SCSI controller
that is on my system (aic799).  The lockups always occur when I'm
backing up to my HP DAT40 that is connected to channel A of this SCSI
controller.  The strange thing is that I backup every night most of the
time without problems to this tape.  
Here is some info on my system:
Kernel: 2.4.6pre3 ( I've been getting the same problem since 2.4.2 )
Here is all the SCSI controller info (the first two are on the
motherboard):
scsi0 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.1.13
        <Adaptec aic7890/91 Ultra2 SCSI adapter>
        aic7890/91: Ultra2 Wide Channel A, SCSI Id=7, 32/255 SCBs
scsi1 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.1.13
        <Adaptec aic7880 Ultra SCSI adapter>
        aic7880: Ultra Single Channel A, SCSI Id=7, 16/255 SCBs
scsi2 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.1.13
        <Adaptec 3960D Ultra160 SCSI adapter>
        aic7899: Ultra160 Wide Channel A, SCSI Id=7, 32/255 SCBs
scsi3 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.1.13
        <Adaptec 3960D Ultra160 SCSI adapter>
        aic7899: Ultra160 Wide Channel B, SCSI Id=7, 32/255 SCBs
This is a PowerEdge 2400 Dual 866Mhz PentiumIII:
Motherboard: ServerWorks Entry ServerSet III LE64 Chipset
HardDrives: Four 36Gig Ultra160 connected to scsi0 (aic7890/91)
TapeDrive: HP DAT40 connected to scsi2
I've checked the termination on the 39160 and everything seems fine.
Would anyone have any pointers?  Please CC:llalonde@giref.ulaval.ca
Thanks.
