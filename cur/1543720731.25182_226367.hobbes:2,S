do you know, by any chance, if this error is dependent to eth0 only or
could help for my error message too:
unregister_netdevice: waiting for ppp0 to become free. Usage count = 1
happened just a few hours ago (2.6.7-rc3), i had to reboot the box
anyway, but pppd was not able to die (even with kill -9)
