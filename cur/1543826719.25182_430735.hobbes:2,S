that just moves the suckage from the mutex-debugging slowpath to the 
irq-handling hotpath. (at which point i still prefer to have that in the 
mutex-debugging path)
a better solution would be to install boot-time IRQ vectors that just do
nothing but return. They dont mask, they dont ACK nor EOI - they just
return. The only thing that could break this is a screaming interrupt,
and even that one probably just slows things down a tiny bit until we
get so far in the init sequence to set up the PIC.
