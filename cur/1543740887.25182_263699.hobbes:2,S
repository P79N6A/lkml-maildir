I already gave you a testcase ages ago. Pretty simple. Get your hands on
a 2G box. boot, swapoff -a, load 1G in pagecache. malloc 1G, bzero 1G,
then open some dozen thousand files until the machine deadlocks despite
1G is perfcetly freeable in highmem.

this stuff run in production for 2 years at least, if anyone would be
screwed I'd already know. The only thing I know is that I've oom
deadlocks in my queue of bugs, and we'll see if this fixes them, it's
hard to tell since I don't know how much lowmem is pinned by highmem
capable allocs (like pagetables!).
