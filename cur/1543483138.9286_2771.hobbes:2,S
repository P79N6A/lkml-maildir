    Hello Andries,

    ]     The 1,6Gb harddisk shows the illegal size  7680Mb instead of 1536Mb
    ]
    ]    version 2.0.36:
    ]     hda: SAMSUNG WNR-31601A (1600MB), 1536MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=780/64/63
    ]     
    ]    version 2.2.1:
    ]     hda: SAMSUNG WNR-31601A (1600MB), 7680MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=3900/64/63

    ]Interesting. I can leave worrying about the detection to Andre.
    ]But I would like to understand this size change.
    ]
    ]So, in your case, what does the disk say, i.e., what is the hdparm output?
    Here the 'hdparm' outputs you have asked for:
    hdparm -I /dev/hda
     RawCHS=3121/16/63, CurCHS=3121/16/63, CurSects=3145968, LBA=yes, LBAsects=15728688
    linux 2.0.36: hdparm -i /dev/hda
     RawCHS=3121/16/63, CurCHS=3121/16/63, CurSects=3145968, LBA=yes, LBAsects=3145968
    linux 2.2.1:  hdparm -i /dev/hda
     RawCHS=15603/16/63, CurCHS=3900/64/63, CurSects=15728688, LBA=yes, LBAsects=15728688
Very good. That makes it all clear.
Yes, it was painful, it hurt the eye, to see the changes made
to the geometry code by our new IDE maintainer. By now it is
clear that every single change was buggy.
Please remove the lines

        if ((id->lba_capacity < 16514064) && (lba_sects > chs_sects) &&
            ((id->heads == 15) || (id->heads == 16)) && (id->sectors == 63)) {
                if (id->heads == 15)
                        id->cyls = lba_sects / (15 * 63); /* correct cyls */
                if (id->heads == 16)
                        id->cyls = lba_sects / (16 * 63); /* correct cyls */
                return 1;       /* lba_capacity is our only option */
        }
from ide-disk.c, and report on whether this solves the size problem.
