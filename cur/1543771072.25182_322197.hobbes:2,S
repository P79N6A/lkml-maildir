Certainly not short-term. Again, it would be nice to have something
better, but heh, you need to go step by step. I have this big rework
where I re-implement most of the pmac suspend code on top of the generic
code (cleans up a lot of stuff) but I don't want to touch the userland
ABI for now, that would be too much of a chance. And /dev/apm_bios X
notofication stuff seems to actually fix problems for some users.

Well, I sort-of work :) I have reported cases of X locking the machine
up under some circumstances. Note that historically, I was not switching
consoles in the pmac PM code, though I'm doing it nowadays.
There are other uses of those "events" in /dev/apm_bios. Some people run
scripts on resume triggered by these for example, etc...
I'd rather not break an existing and relied upon userland interface now,
at least not until we have a well accepted replacement that has been
around for some time.
I do agree however that it may be nice to make the APM emulation code
more generic & shared between architectures. That's something I intend
to look into next. But I would like my current stuff to get in after
2.6.12 is released.
Ben.
