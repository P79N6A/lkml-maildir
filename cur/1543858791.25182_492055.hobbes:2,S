I don't care what you're for, or what your imaginary "free software 
community" is for.
We're "open source", and we're not a religion. We don't "twist peoples 
arms". We show people what we think is a better way, and we let them 
participate. We don't force it, we don't twist it, and it's ok not to 
believe in the GPL or our ideals. In fact, "our ideals" aren't even one 
unified thing to begin with.
We also don't try to pervert copyright into a "you have to _use_ things 
in a certain way". We don't think "fair use" is a bad thing. We encourage 
it, and that means that we have to abide by it ourselves. It means, most 
particularly, that even people we disagree with have that right of "fair 
use".
That, btw, is what "freedom" and "rights" are all about. It's obly 
meaningful when you grant those rights to people you don't agree with. 
Also, since you haven't apparently gotten the memo yet, let me point it 
out to you: the end results don't justify the means, and never did. So 
arm-twisting doesn't become good just because you think the end result 
might be worth it. It's still bad.
And btw, that "information freedom" thing you talked about is just so much 
blather and idiotic hogwash. "Information" doesn't want to be free, nor is 
it somethign you should fight for or necessarily even encourage.
It doesn't hold a candle to _peoples_ freedom, the foremost of which is to 
just disagree with you. Once you allow people to talk and do what they 
want, that "information freedom" will follow.
It's not a religion, and it's not about suppressing other people and other 
viewpoints.
