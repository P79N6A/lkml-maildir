It is a common problem with Dell's DSDT implementation which does not
follow ACPI spec and it's been going on for ages. From the original
report:
cpufreq: CPU0 - ACPI performance management activated
 cpufreq: *P0: 1Mhz, 0 mW, 0 uS
 cpufreq: P1: 0Mhz, 0 mW, 0 uS
 divide error: 0000 [#1]
As you can see all data is bogus... Patching DSDT cures it for sure,
sometimes CONFIG_ACPI_RELAXED_AML helps as well.
I suppose ACPI P-states driver could check frequencies/latencies and
refuse to activate if the are bogus.
