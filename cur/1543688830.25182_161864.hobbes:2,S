Thanks Larry.  That's a great range you have!
Collected and will be posted shortly in a table with the others.

AIX would be interesting; I don't have an RS6000.  The rest of the
CPUs I have results for, and it sounds like a lot of effort for what's
basically a compile/compatibility test.
However, if it's very little effort for you to run the test on them please do!
Thanks,
