Version is CVS-latest, checked out last night.
Some of the failures were obvious:  kernel module syscalls were failing, 
as I would expect them to if they had not been updated for 2.5.x module 
support.  There were also a couple signal-related things, IIRC. 
Unexpected failures included some file locking test failures.
Anyway, don't worry... you will be getting more concrete info soon :)  I 
am tracking down right now why the 2.5.x floppy driver ends all I/O 
requests with an error.  After that, I'll have output from a full LTP 
run for you :)
