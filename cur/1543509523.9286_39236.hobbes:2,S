"Popular" (my definition of it :) devices work well. By that, I mean
things like keyboards, mice, hubs. Audio devices are being worked on, as
are cameras. UPSs and other power devices are being worked on. Ethernet
adapters are on the list, and we're getting some support. Parallel and
serial converters are nonstandard, proprietary, and not supported. 
Did I miss anything?
