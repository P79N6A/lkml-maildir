Hi,
what happens to mounts when the namespace they exist in, exits?
In my concrete case:
	./newns /bin/bash
	# clone(CLONE_NEWNS | CLONE_THREAD | CLONE_SIGHAND | CLONE_VM)
	# and exec to given program
	mount /dev/loop0 /mnt
	exit
Still mounted and unreachable forever? Forced unmount and fs corruption?
	Jan
