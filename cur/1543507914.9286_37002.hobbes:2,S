Subject: Scsi card detection order in 2.2.x

  I have  multiple scsi cards in the same machine(ie ICP/NCR) and I need
the scsi
  disks detected in the same order every time. In 2.2.x is the only way
to do this by
  my modifying the order in hosts.c ? I could use a combination of
kernel/module loads
  but I would prefer to have both drivers in the kernel.
  The specific problem I'm running into is when a temporary external jaz
is connected
  to the ncr scsi. Because the ncr is detected before the ICP the root
disk now ends up
  as sdb instead of sda.
