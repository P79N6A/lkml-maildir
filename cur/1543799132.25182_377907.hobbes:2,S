Listen, for anyone who "needs" 8K stacks they can maintain the patch
themselves, they don't need it in the mainline kernel.   One of the points
of removing the 8K stack option is to singal to vendors and everyone else
that bugs arising from using 8K stacks and ** ANY ** sloppy code that
_needs_ 8K stacks is no longer appropriate for mainline.  The kernel
doesn't just carry around a bunch of crappy options because someone
somewhere thinks he needs it.
