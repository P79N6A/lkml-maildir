Pardon me for not fully groking the issues here and possibly coming to a
wrong conclusion, but this has to do with SMP systems crashing at APIC
init time, just before penguin display (with fbcon at least)? If so, I
have a board that does this with certain cache settings made in the BIOS.
It's a 430HX chipset with two Pentium MMX 200s installed, *ancient* BIOS.
