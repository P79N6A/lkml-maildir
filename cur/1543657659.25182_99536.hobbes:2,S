  whatever happened to that funky option from 2.4 --
for kernel .config support, which allegedly buried the
config file inside the kernel itself.  (it never worked --
the alleged extraction script scripts/extract-ikconfig
depended on a program called "binoffset" that didn't 
exist in that distribution.)
  any plans to resurrect this, or something like it?
