What for?  The kernel already optimises readahead and writebehind for
sequential files.
If you want to provide specific extra hints to the kernel, then things
like O_UNCACHE might be more appropriate to instruct the kernel to
explicitly remove the cached page after IO completes (to avoid the VM
overhead of maintaining useless cache).  That would provide a definite
improvement over normal IO for large multimedia-style files or for
huge copies.  But what part of the normal handling of sequential files
would O_SEQUENTIAL change?  Good handling of sequential files should
be the default, not an explicitly-requested feature.
Cheers, 
 Stephen
