I was looking at the 2.6.21 code, sorry.
Hmm, I guess we could add an additional mutex that would only be taken in
flush_workqueue() and in _cpu_down()/_cpu_up() via workqueue_cpu_callback()
with CPU_LOCK_ACQUIRE?
It doesn't seem to be a good idea to run flush_workqueue() while CPUs are being
taken up and down anyway.
Greetings,
