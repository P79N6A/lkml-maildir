Well, I suggested the kernel/time/timekeeping.c change go in last cycle,
when you pushed your other cleanups, because that sort of large,
move-tons-of-code patch sucks to keep out of the tree for long as it
would surely collide with something at some point.

Hmmm. I just don't quite see the severity of the conflict.
Nonetheless, code talks, so don't let me get in the way, but I really
think patching on top of the HRT queue is the best way forward. 
Even if they revert portions, it clearly points out why your changes
would be better, focusing the discussion, instead of just making a large
alternate patch queue.
