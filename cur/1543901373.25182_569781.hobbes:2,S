Con's patches are not really touching the network subsystem, but we want 
to analyze this and figure out where the difference in behavior comes 
from, be that scheduling, networking or something else.
to help us figure out the nature of the delay, could you do another 
thing as well:
  strace -ttt -TTT -f -o firefox.trace.txt -p `pidof firefox-bin`
this will produce firefox.trace.txt - compress that via bzip -9. (and 
send that file privately - it might include private information embedded 
in URLs, etc.) Please do such a trace both under CFS and under -ck, 
under similar circumstances.
To isolate it down to the CPU scheduler changes you can create a pure 
2.6.22+SD kernel by applying this patch to a vanilla v2.6.22 tree:
