Then how am I going to merge fbdev and DRM so that we don't have two
drivers fighting over the same hardware? I was planning on adding
pieces of the existing fbdev code to DRM in order to implement printk
from the kernel. It seems silly for me to rewrite 10,000 lines of code
just to make it BSD licensed when BSD isn't even going to use the
code.
What is wrong with marking each CVS commit with BSD/GPL license? Then
having the BSD people pick off the relevant code.
