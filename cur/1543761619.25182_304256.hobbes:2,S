Just fyi, the only swsusp patches I currently have queued are
swsusp-add-missing-refrigerator-calls.patch
swsusp-suspend_pd_pages-fix.patch
suspend-to-ram-update-videotxt-with-more-systems.patch
I've been ducking all the "swsusp_restore crap" patches.  Pavel, could you
please aggregate, test and resend everything when the dust has settled?
