Maybe I was lucky, but I too installed the latest kernel
in 2.3.X to get my webcam working.
I included the step make xconfig AND
... included kernel support for USB
... Included kernel support for video4linux
... included kernel support for my cheapy CPiA webcam
make bzlilo....  (bzdisk should work too, I guess?????)
rebooted, and watched with glee as the little green light on the
camera turned on...
Relevent extracts from "dmesg" are:

Hope this helps.
I am well pleased, and the camera works fine,  but would be happy pick the
brains of anyone willing to share experiences with Linux webcam software..
I am a novice in this respect, and am making painfully slow progress.

Like you say, it could be easier... avoid insmod.... :-)
