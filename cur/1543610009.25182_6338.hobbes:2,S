The numbers translate to the family/model/stepping fields
of /proc/cpuinfo.
The only older models certified as safe for SMP are.
 Athlon model 6, stepping 0 CPUID = 660
 Athlon model 6, stepping 1 CPUID = 661
 Duron  model 7, stepping 0 CPUID = 670
The newer models..
 model 6 stepping 2 and above 662
 model 7 stepping 1 and above 671
have a cpuid flag that must be compared to find out if they
are capable or not. Note that these id's tally with XP's and MP's.
The capability bit is the only way to distinguish between these models.
Hope this makes it clearer.
regards,
Dave.
