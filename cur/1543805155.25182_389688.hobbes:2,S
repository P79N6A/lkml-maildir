I do disagree that as I am envisioning it will get in the way but I
do agree that putting them in the unsigned long may be overkill.
There is at least NFS lockd that appreciates having a single integer
per process unique identifier.  So there is a practical basis for
wanting such a thing.
At least for this first round I think talking about a kpid
as a container, pid pair makes a lot of sense for the moment, as
the other implementations just confuse things.

Possibly.  Again, it is one of the more interesting cases, to get
just right.
However it looks to me that the biggest challenge right now about
development is the size of a patch to change any one of these things.
So it looks to me like the first step is to add wrappers for common idioms
that use pids, like printing the name of a task or testing if it is the
init task or if it is an idle task.
Or can you think of a case where it would be wise to leave
both the type and size of current->pid alone?
