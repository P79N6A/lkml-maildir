If you then fold this on top we have 3 patches, alas not along the lines
that would have been pretty:
 - update_min_vruntime fix
 - SCHED_IDLE weight change
 - SCHED_IDLE vs SCHED_OTHER isolation
But I guess that's life.

Subject: sched: fix update_min_vruntime
From: Peter Zijlstra <a.p.zijlstra@chello.nl>

OK, so we have 1 running task A (which is obviously curr and the tree is
equally obviously empty).
A nicely chugs along, doing its thing, carrying min_vruntime along as it
goes.
Then some whacko speed freak SCHED_IDLE task gets inserted due to SMP
balancing, which is very likely far right, in that case
update_curr
  update_min_vruntime
    cfs_rq->rb_leftmost := true (the crazy task sitting in a tree)
      vruntime = se->vruntime
and voila, min_vruntime is waaay right of where it ought to be.
OK, so why did I write it like that to begin with...
Aah, yes.
Say we've just dequeued current
schedule
  deactivate_task(prev)
    dequeue_entity
      update_min_vruntime
Then we'll set
  vruntime = cfs_rq->min_vruntime;
we find !cfs_rq->curr, but do find someone in the tree. Then we _must_
do vruntime = se->vruntime, because
 vruntime = min_vruntime(vruntime := cfs_rq->min_vruntime, se->vruntime)
will not advance vruntime, and cause lags the other way around (which we
fixed with that initial patch: 1af5f730fc1bf7c62ec9fb2d307206e18bf40a69
(sched: more accurate min_vruntime accounting).
