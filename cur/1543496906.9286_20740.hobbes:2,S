No, not really.  That 60k is 60 separate 1k IOs with a seek/disk
rotation latency between each one.  With any significant CPU work being
done between those IOs, 60 in a second is perfectly reasonable.  High
disk bandwidth only works when you are streaming sequentially off the
disk: if you are doing lots of separate 1k IOs, IOs/second is a much
more meaningful figure than kB/second.
