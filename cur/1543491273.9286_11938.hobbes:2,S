   No, dave. I've actually spotted the bug and posted diff ;-). They
   clear some usage counter at some point and than refuse to decrement
   module usage count because counter is zero.
Oops, my apologies :-)  I wan't paying attention.
What I said does happen though, in particular I see it a lot with
modules which create procfs directories/files (Sparc's openpromfs is a
good example).
