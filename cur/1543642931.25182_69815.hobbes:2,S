I have two machines on a KVM and when I switch between them the mouse
pointer goes wacky and causes random clicks. This has always been
somewhat of a problem when both machines were running 2.4 but there was
a workaround.  If I switched consoles (alt-F1, alt-F7) then the mouse
would restore back to correct behaviour. 
Now, on my test machine running 2.5 the mouse works until I do a KVM
machine swap. Then the 2.5 machine never clears up the mouse wackiness
and the only choice is to reboot. 
The mouse is a Logitech optical mouse with a wheel "Wheel mouse". The
mouseconfig is the same on both machines. The KVM is a Belkin four port.
Probably the simplest is to buy another mouse or switch to USB...
