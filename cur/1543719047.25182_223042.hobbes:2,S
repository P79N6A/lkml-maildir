No. I am not making any assertions whatsoever. I am just calling out that
systems that run happily from physical memory and are not in need of swap
should never sacrifice an ounce of performance for even drastic improvements
to swap performance. Swap is a band-aid for saving money on memory and a few
years ago, it allowed you to save a substantial amount of money. 
Whether the cost savings for utilizing swap vs buying more memory are
substantial as of late is subject to opinion, but I cannot think of a system
that I have sized in the last three years where swap was expected to be used
except in un-anticipated memory shortfalls. In fact, if I didn't plan to
store crash dumps on the swap device, I think I would have omitted swap all
together in many configurations.
I have worked at large fortune 500 companies with deep pockets though, so
this may not be the case for many. I make this point though because I think
if it isn't the case yet, it will be in the near future as memory becomes
even cheaper because the trend certainly exists.
As for your short, two sentence comment below, let me save you the energy of
insinuations and translate your message the way I read it: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't recognize your name, therefore you can't possibly have a valuable
opinion on the direction VM system development should go. I doubt you have
an actual performance problem to share, but if you do, please share it and
go away so that we can work on solving the problem.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My response:
Get over yourself.
Regards,

If you've got a real performance issue, please describe it properly
instead of asserting without evidence the existence of one.
