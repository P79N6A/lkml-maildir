I have a production machine which also is an AMD K6-233, running
2.0.37-pre4.
This machine has a light load but also managed to have a clock skew of
over 20 minutes each day (okay, light, I got an totally niced rc5 client
running too). I solved it by running '/sbin/clock -r' to read the time
from the CMOS which does keep a correct time. Maybe it has something to
do with the fact that it's and AMD-K6 233Mhz or the rc5 client with MMX
extensions might do something weird, I dunno.
