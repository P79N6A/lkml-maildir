Both Andi and Pete solve the problem of the limit on the number of
available reserved ports.
In addition, Pete fixes a second problem. There is a limit to the
number of 'unnamed' devices that the kernel can support (see the
function get_unnamed_dev()). Since each NFS mount 'eats' one such
device, this sets an upper limit of 255 simultaneous of NFS mounts
whether or not we have enough reserved ports.
