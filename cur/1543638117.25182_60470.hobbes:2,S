I encountered the same problem with some 2.4.xx kernels. Sometimes FTP or
MySQL connections 'hang' and the message "sending pkt_too_big to self"
appears in the kernel log files.
When you take a search at google:
http://www.google.nl/search?q=
%22sending+pkt_too_big+to+self%22 you will
find more people with this problem.
Has someone an explanation for this?
