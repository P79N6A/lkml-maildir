There has been a scam where the "133" in the BIOS was replaced by
"333" and the resulting machines were sold as faster than they
actually were... 
You can count on it that with the above output, your CPU is running at
133 when Linux boots. It could be that the CPU is put in "slow" mode
if you run on the batteries. (Is it a laptop? I missed the beginning
of this thread).
