In which case there is a bug in the printer. Its like you saying "the wheels
fell of my car, your road is buggy"
If you can scope the parallel port during the printing and find a transaction
that violates the spec then that is worth reporting, and its probably what
both you and the linux people need to fix the problem.
What I would guess is far more likely though is a bug in the printer engine
tripped by Linux generated postscript not NT generated postscript. You may
want to try grabbing Linux postscript as 'print to file' then printing it
from NT a bit
