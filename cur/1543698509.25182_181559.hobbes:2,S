Well, I had to try that here. I've got a Celeron 650Mhz with 320MB ram
and a crappy 14GB HD and yes the finds in the xterms are stopping for
some time ... BUT X is 100% responsive. there is no sluggishness, I can
use mozilla, etc without a problem. so seriously, who makes 10 finds at
the same time and finds are read from FS (I have XFS) so it might be a
problem with that. So I don't think the scheduler is bad, I think it is
great. When I switched to 2.5 the first time on that box it was like
"WOW", so little swapping and KDE is so smooth ... thats so wow ...
Still there are some minor problems (japanese keyboard eg) but that will
smooth out when Programs get adapted.
But for your problem, it might get better for these kind of things in
later versions :)
