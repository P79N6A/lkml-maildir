Please, never *ever* do this.
Locking is probably the hardest thing to get right, and code like this
makes it harder.
Fortunately, there is a simple solution coming with the hotplug CPU
code: we need to hold the cpucontrol semaphore here anyway, against
cpus vanishing.
Perhaps we should just use that in both places.
Rusty.
