One very last comment: I think for our problem to
ensure consitency of hypervisor data, when an application
always wants to get the complete set of information,
the "one file" solution with a fully specified ASCII
tag language format looks for me to be the easiest way
to implement our solution. And I think, if one decides to
use one file to provide all the information, it is better to
have a standard data format than always invent new
formats. And to use a standard ASCII format is
in my eyes also better than to have a binary interface.
If everybody says, that it is in principal not a good idea
to use one file, than a snapshot mechanism
for filesystems is probably go good method to provide
consitency. And this is definitely not my decission...
