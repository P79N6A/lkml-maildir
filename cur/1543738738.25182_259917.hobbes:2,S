Of course. Though since DS and SS need the same parameters, they might
actualy point to the same GDT entry. I don't know if they actualy do,
though.
By the way, C compilers usualy set SS and DS with same base. They would
have to do conversion when taking pointers to local variables otherwise.

Yes, it does. Few people touch the "Kernel Hacking" though...

No, it's not. There is just one kernel memory. In it each process has
it's own task_struct + kernel stack (by default 8K). There is no special
address mapping for these, nor are they allocated from a special area.
When a context of some process is entered, esp is pointed to the top of
it's stack. That's exactly all it takes to exchange stacks.
