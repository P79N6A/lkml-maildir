Which looks correct from RFC 1042 (could be wrong, only did the quick
15-minute
review so I may have missed something).
if you are speaking both ether and token ring over the same wire, then
it is up to the guy who is speaking both to make sure the media type
field is kept track of.
Now if the linux box is configed to be looking at both and isn't
accepting, then it's a linux bug, but I don't think that was the
situation in this case.
