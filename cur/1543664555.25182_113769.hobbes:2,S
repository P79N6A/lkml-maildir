Integrating in to existing spellcheckers is a Good Idea,
though it might not totally replace the perl script Matthias
wrote (does ispell have a batch mode that works on whole
directory trees?).
BTW, ispell on my system is gnu aspell,
and I couldn't tell for the life of me from the manual
whether it supports this kind of filter.
Nor could I find any doc on ispell filters.
Where's the best place to learn about 'em?
