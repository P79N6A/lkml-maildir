well... I doubt whether buddy allocator would take u to a situation where pages
0 and 2 are used and 1 and 3 are free...
try reading __get_free_pages in mm/page_alloc.c

Hi,
For this scenario consider a set of 4 page frames.
Frames 0 and 2 are used while frames 1 and 3 are free.
The question is would the bitmap for order 1 be a 1 or 0 for this scenario.
I am not on the list so please cc me on your response.
Thanks in advance.
