Yes, sorry, it was Sergio.

It's not only the content that matters, but the way the content is
written to CD. If you write your stuff in TAO or SAO (which can be DAO,
DAO alone isn't valid) it's no problem. Examples are:
- cdrecord -dao ...
- cdrdao --driver generic-mmc
If you write CDs in RAW modes, then there's the problem with the high
loads. Examples:
- cdrecord -raw96r/p (2448 bytes/sector)
- cdrecord -raw16    (2368 bytes/sector)
- cdrdao --driver generic-mmc-raw (2368 bytes/sector)
So for Sergio: Try using the generic-mmc without raw driver in cdrdao.
And audio CDs or (S)VCDs are written in mode2 (2352 bytes/sector) and
also cause the high loads, this time independent from the writing mode.
AFAIK this behaviour should be the same on any Linux system.

Markus
