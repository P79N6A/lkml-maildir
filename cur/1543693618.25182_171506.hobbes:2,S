To start with, if I have a server with 1400 clients, instead of 1400
threads with 1400(+overhead) fd's each, I have 1400 threads with
1(+overhead) fd's. While memory waste is "broken" the way you mean, it
is significant.
And since one thread can close a file which it's done with it, without
affecting all the other threads, or open a file without forcing it into
all other threads, so system overhead is reduced there as well.

The truth table is "if you don't like the way it works don't use it."
Since this only affects programs which choose to use it you can pretend
it isn't there.

| /proc/<pid>/whatever.
I have already suggested that traditional threads just have their fd be
a symlink to the main process fd, making it easy to identify, and for
non-fd-sharing threads have the fd entries which refer to inherited fd's
also be symlinks. Others have independently made the same or similar
suggestions. What you suggest would seem to break existing software
which expects an fd directory in /proc/<pid>.
