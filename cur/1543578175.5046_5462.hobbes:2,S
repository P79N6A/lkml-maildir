I tried "mem=4M" -- no effect. The value of pte is 0xc0001000, so it seems
to be the first invocation of that statement in the for() loop.
Now comes the amazing (to me) part: I split the above statement up into:
	temp = mk_pte_phys(__pa(vaddr), PAGE_KERNEL);
	*pte = temp;
where temp is declared "volatile pte_t". I inserted test-prints between the
above two lines. Accoding to that, the _first_ line , i.e. the evaluation of the
mk_pte_phys() macro is causing the crash!
I am still trying to figure out what mk_pte_phys() does. Apparently it involves
an access to the kernel's data section. My current guess is that the data
section is not correctly mapped at this point. Would that be possible ?
