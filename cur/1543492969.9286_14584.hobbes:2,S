Not true.  Some other OSes (in particular, filesystems based on the
FFS, Berkeley Fast File System) do use some synchronous writes, but
only when creating and deleting files and only for the metadata, not
the data itself.  Synchronous data writes are only enabled if you
explicitly ask for them (Linux included).
The reason FFS uses synchronous metadata writes is not to give the
application any on-disk consistency semantics (although the nature of
the writes do imply at least some consistency guarantees), but to
ensure that the order in which metadata structures are updated is
predictable so that after a crash, the filesystem state can be
recovered predictably.  It does _not_ guarantee to recover your data.

Just like for all of the other filesystems in question.
Cheers,
