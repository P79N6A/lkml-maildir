Ask Andrew Grover. I don't follow the ACPI threads. Having attempted to use
ACPI both on Linux and other OS's I've given up. Adding a bloated interpreter 
for an obscure, misdesigned bios hardware description language is simply not
my idea of progress. Its an extremely complicated way for intel to try and
keep stuff like speedstep proprietary, nothing more. 
APM works nicely on all my Athlons.
