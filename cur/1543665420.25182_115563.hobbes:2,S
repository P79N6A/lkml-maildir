Subject: [BK PATCH] gen_init_cpio fixes for 2.5.64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here are two patches split out of the big klibc patch that fix some
problems in the gen_init_cpio.c code.  The first one allows files to be
added to the cpio image and fixes a padding error, and the second one
fixes some build problems with the cpio image (if there was an error,
the build would not stop.)
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/initramfs-2.5
I'll send the two patches as followups to this message to lkml for those
who want to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h

  kbuild: handle any failures of the gen_init_cpio or initramfs image to stop the build.
  
  This also shows how to add files to the initramfs build, but is 
  commented out.
  
  Patch originally done by Kai.
