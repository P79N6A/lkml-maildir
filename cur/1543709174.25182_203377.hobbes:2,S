Hi 
Looking at 2.6.3-bk, it appears that the sysctl code does not raise a
module's reference count before calling a sysctl handler registered by
that module. 
- are modules allowed to register sysctl handlers?
register_sysctl_table is exported, so I imagine so. 
- am I missing something and modules are in fact protected against
concurrent unloading and invocation of sysctl?
Cheers, 
Muli
