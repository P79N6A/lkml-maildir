Grab the ncp package from 
http://www.fefe.de/ncp/,
 or more specifically
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/network/ncp/ncp-1.2.3.tar.bz2.
It's a very useful and handy tool for pushing around data within
a LAN of a small workgroup, one guy does "npush foo" and yells
at the intended recepient "do npoll". The first one to do
it wins and gets foo ;-)
