I found that i810_audio driver v0.19 from 
	
http://people.redhat.com/dledford/i810_audio.c.gz
still freezes machine after /dev/dsp is being closed 
(printk at end of i810_release()). It doesn't happen always though.
I did tests under KDE. artsd is setup to close /dev/dsp after being idle 
for 5 seconds. System rather often (but not always) freezes
after that.
Earlier v0.14 from
	
http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/Staff/tom/SiS7012/i810_audio-020105.c
doen't cause similar problems for me
