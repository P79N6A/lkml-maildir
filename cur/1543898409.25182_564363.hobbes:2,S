Hi! Recently I've found out that my camera NIKON D50 can't mount any more.

Some time ago(I really can't remember version of the kernel)
everything was Ok. I'll try to find out the workable version of the
kernel ... but I've already tried 2.6.20 - the same =(.
I'm not sure, but It's possible that I've had ATA subsystem but not
libata ... I haven't tested this case yet.
PS. I can see photos on my camera ... flash card is Ok. I have this
problem even if I changed the flash card in this camera.
