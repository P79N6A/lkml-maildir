Well, indeed it would be more elegant to rename the existing flags variable
and use another bit out of it, but I personally don't think it's _that_
important.  At least, I don't think we should block the patch because of that.
BTW, has anyone confirmed that it works on i386?
BTW2, Nigel, please fix the formats in s2ram_beep_show()/_store(), they
cause gcc to spit ugly warnings on some architectures.
Greetings,
Rafael
