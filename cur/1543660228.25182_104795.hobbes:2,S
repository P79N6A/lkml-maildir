Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.58 stradis.c fixes to make it compile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've corrected stradis.c in 2.5.58 to compile properly, and
since Linus is out of town, I've attached it to this message
and placed it at the following location as well:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/laredo/stradis-2.5.58.diff
If you actually have this hardware (I haven't gotten any
reports from anyone actually trying to use it with 2.5.x)
please let me know of success or failure.   I would have had
this done sooner but I didn't know this was broken since Alan
never bothered to tell me he changed the video device
interface.
