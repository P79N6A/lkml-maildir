Andre,
As you know I have been looking at the task file issues with
implementing SMART and think I have figured it out.  I am assuming the
ioctl command for sendings ATA commands is as follows:
ioctl ( device, HDIO_DRIVE_CMD, { TF.7 , TF.3, TF.1, TF.2} );
where
TF.7 is the IDE_CONTROL_REG
TF.3 is the IDE_SECTOR_REG
TF.1 is the IDE_FEATURE_REG
TF.2 is the IDE_NSECTOR_REG
The task file register values were not being sent to the hard drive
correctly. So I made the small patch below to deal with the problem of
SMART commands. It fixed the problem for mine and Ragnar's SMART
utilities. I have tested both utilities with the patch and they work. To
do it right, the ide_cmd function needs some changes. Which requires
also change ide-disk.c. I can do it if you would like.
The patch was made with the latest 2.2.12 kernel with the
ide.2.2.12.19990921.patch.gz
