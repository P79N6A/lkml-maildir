This seems to be this BUG:
BUG_ON(!list_empty(&req->queuelist));
in drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c. I don't know how this could be non-empty
since scsi_end_request calls
if (blk_rq_tagged(req))
         blk_queue_end_tag(q, req);
just before calling end_that_request_last inside the same spinlock.
I don't know anything about tagged request handling but I don't think
this is the fault of the dm-crypt driver, perhaps it's stressing the
queue in some unexpected way? I have no idea what's going on here.
