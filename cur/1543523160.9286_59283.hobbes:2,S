As has been stated convincingly here (for me, at least) very high load
means a runqueue of at the very most 10, ridiculous overload gives some
30. So your scheduler (using your own measurements!) hurts performance
except for ridiculous overload (and contrieved benchmarks). Those aren't
the cases I want Linux to be optimized for.
