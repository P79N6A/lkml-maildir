Yes, scheduler_tick is called from interrupt context.

Although it is said that you can't access user memory from an interrupt
context, the reasons are simple.  One, most user memory access can
schedule, and an interrupt service routine must not schedule. Also, an
interrupt service routine can happen on any thread, so you can't be sure
what thread is there.
But, when an interrupt goes off, whatever thread is running is still
there.  The thread's context _is_ still there.  The changing to the
interrupt stack takes special care to make sure that current still works.
So a copy of the thread_info is also done. Look in the do_IRQ in
arch/i386/kernel/irq.c and search for 4KSTACKS.  You will see there the
copying of thread_info.
