  While MS boxes are responsible for a lot of stupid things, this is most
likely the case when there was no such domain in the first place. Local
box simply has hostname red, /etc/hosts has red and red.prv, and there is
no any .prv. zone on the local nameserver or anywhere. Once some program
queries local nameserver with red.prv, it can't find a nameserver for
red.prv. because there really isn't such a thing.
