Not sure probably - I can ask.
Intel explained it to me thus:
When the i-fetch has been done and the micro-ops are in the trace cache
then there's no longer a direct correlation between the original machine
instruction boundaries and the micro ops. This is due to optimization. For
example (artificial one for illustrative purposes):
mov eax,ebx
mov memory,eax
mov eax,1
(using intel notation not ATT - force of habit)
In the trace cache there would be no micro ops to update eax with ebx.
Altering the "mov eax,ebx" to "mov ecx,ebx" on the fly invalidates the
optimized trace cache, hence the onlhy recourse is a GPF.
If the modification doens't invalidate the trace cache then no GPF. The
question is: "can we predict th circumstances when the trace cache has not
been invalidated", and the answer in general is no since the
microarchtecture is not public. But one can guess that modifying the single
byte opcode with in interrupting instruction  - int3 - doesn't cause an
inconsistency that can't be handled. And that's what Intel confirmed. Go
ahead and store int3 without the need to synchronise (i.e. force the trace
cache to be flushed).
My guess is that AMD behaves exactly the same way. But I'll check.
