Apparently, more than that. You'll need at least vfsmount in addition to
dentry. Could you send me the source? In principle, situation looks like
you need path_init() and path_walk(), but you almost definitely will need
to make changes in more places than that.
It should be easy to fix, but it's easier to mark the places that need
fixing in the source than try to describe how to find them ;-)
