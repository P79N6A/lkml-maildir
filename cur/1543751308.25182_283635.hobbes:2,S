I just did some experimentation on one of my boxes. For me the ACPI
shutdown problem:
+ does not happen on mainline 2.6.9
+ does not happen on 2.6.9-ac16
+ does happen on 2.6.9-1.724_FC3
+ does not happen on mainline 2.6.10
+ does not happen on 2.6.10-1.727_FC3
Just mentioning it for whatever relevance it may have to this debate,
and in case it helps find a fix. (I'll see if I can narrow things down
any further.)
