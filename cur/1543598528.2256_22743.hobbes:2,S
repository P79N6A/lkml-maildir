Subject: [PATCH] one-liner fix to sddr09.c for >= 64MB SmartMedia

Hello,
I found a problem with getting the LBA <-> PBA mapping from a 64MB
SmartMedia card in an SDDR09 card reader.  The mapping is read from the
card into 2 128k sg's.  The problem occurs when looking at the data in the
second sg.  The memory is accessed with an offset from the beginning of
all the data, regardless of which sg is being read from.  So, in the case
of the second sg, the data read is actually whatever memory is right after
the memory allocated to that sg.
Here is the one-liner fix.  It worked with my card and I believe this
should work for larger cards, althought I have none to test with.

Hopefully this will make it into the kernel in the near future.
