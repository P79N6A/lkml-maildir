Hmm, I wanted to test your revoke-munmap.c to see what you get right now
with munmap, but a quick port of your patch to yesterdays -git on s390
gives me an oops on do_revoke.  I'll have to straighten that out when I
get a chance.
But since it looks like you just munmap the region now, shouldn't a
subsequent munmap by the app just return -EINVAL?  that seems appropriate
to me.
thanks,
