        It is nothing new, and works as intended.

	Which is there to please Linus so that he didn't want
	to rip out the entire modularity of IPv6.
	Somewhen along 2.5 I hope to have enough time to separate
	UDP, and TCP into their common modules, plus IPv4/IPv6
	specific ones and have the entire shebang to do proper
	usage counting. (That is, have a IPv6 ONLY system built
	from modules -- unless someone beats me to that goal.)
