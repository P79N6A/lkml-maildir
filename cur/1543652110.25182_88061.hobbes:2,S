I've tried to reproduce this also on a RH 7.3 box.  ksmserver is
running, but strace says it's stuck on a select() call.  There are no
kernel messages, but I got this from startx:
DCOPServer up and running.
Warning: connect() failed: : Connection refused
It looks like maybe this problem shows up in different ways.  Anyone
have ideas about how to debug this?
