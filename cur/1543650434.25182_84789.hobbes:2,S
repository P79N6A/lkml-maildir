Yep, that was my assumption.
If your ROM is directly addressable, i.e. not read over a single-bit bus 
or anything, it should be doable.  I'm not saying that initramfs will do 
this out of the box :) but going from initramfs to "initromfs" should 
not be a huge leap...
However, that said, things also depend on what proggies you are running 
in your initramfs.  You may be running code that only runs at startup 
when the kernel boots, in which case the best space utilization would be 
to uncompress a compressed image out of ROM to RAM, use it to bootstrap, 
and then free [unlink] all the initramfs files that are no longer needed.
