If ALSA's OSS emulator does not support mixing properly, it's a bug
in ALSA, clearly, because real OSS in 2.4 allowed for mixing, as long
as the hardware supported it. I played Doom while listening to MP3s on
ymfpci (which, in fact, was a copy of ALSA's ymfpci with OSS API on top).
If ALSA developers wanted, they could have supported mixing in their OSS
emulator. They intentionally chose not to, in order to create an incentive
for developers to program in native ALSA.
