I've tried 2-200 processes range on my dual Celeron box and  0-1000
penalty range.

Uhm... Unfortunately,I don't have any of those 8way Zeon boxes at home
:)

My opinion is that probaly penalty value should change depending on
loadavg dynamically...Possible? Usable? :)

Ok,I'll post it when I'll be at home.
