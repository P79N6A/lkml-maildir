When trying to compile 2.5.30-dj1 with using the 2.5 IDE code compilation
fails as follows (it seems the problem is also present in plain 2.5.30):
<--  snip  -->
...
  gcc -Wp,-MD,./.hd.o.d -D__KERNEL__
-I/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.5/linux-2.5.30-full/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common
-pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=k6 -nostdinc -iwithprefix
include    -DKBUILD_BASENAME=hd   -c -o hd.o hd.c
hd.c: In function `hd_geninit':
hd.c:859: `i' undeclared (first use in this function)
hd.c:859: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
hd.c:859: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [hd.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.5/linux-2.5.30-full/drivers/ide'
