I would really like to see this code. Is it available on the web some where ?

With the nopage changes CFS also have a token based synchronization mechanism. 
The token code now works at the granularity of file. But very well can be made to work with file data ranges (range tokens).
To kind of explain how it works with CFS, When you want to map a page you request token server and token server grant
you token. Now somebody when trying to do a write map will result in the above mapped page being unmapped and shipped to the 
other node. So as long as all are readers there can be multiple nodes sharing the same page. 
When one of the node is in writer mode, Then token server will force to unmap the page from  other nodes when ever there
is a page access.
All these code is opensourced as a part of OpenSSI project. BTW I am only saying that the code at www.openssi.org may be
of interest to you.
