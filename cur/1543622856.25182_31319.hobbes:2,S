Kernel patch set jp6 of the Linux kernel 2.4.18
Jörg Prante <joerg@infolinux.de>
http://infolinux.de/jp6
What is it?
The -jp kernels are development kernels and for testing purpose only. They 
will appear regularly two or three times a month. Their purpose is to provide 
a service for developers who can't keep up to date with the latest kernel and 
patch versions, but want to test new features and evaluate enhancements that 
are not to be expected for inclusion into the mainstream 2.4 kernel.
You are missing a patch? Patches will be added by request.
I use the-jp kernel on my Dell Inspiron to get more experience on kernel 
hacking. It's a 2.4 patch set because I want to keep my data.
