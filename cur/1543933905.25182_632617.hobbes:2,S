In 2.6.23's shrink_inactive_list function, why do we have to call
clear_active_flags after isolate_lru_pages call ?
IMHO, If it call isolate_lru_pages with "zone->inactive_list", It can
be sure that it is not PG_active. So I think It is unnecessary calling
clear_active_flags. Nonetheless, Why do we have to recheck PG_active
flags wich clear_active_flags.
If it is right, which case it happens that page is set to be PG_active ?
