Yeah, that's fine, but it's easier to review and integrate if patches to 
update the API are separate files and mails (e.g. 2/3, 3/3, etc.).  Makes for 
more detailed changelog comments and makes changes in the bk tree much easier 
to track.  In general, the smaller, the better.

Yeah, that's fine.

Sounds like that could be a separate cleanup patch.

Sounds good, probably a separate patch too.
Thanks,
