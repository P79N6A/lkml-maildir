There is a lindent script in linux kernel source.  It breaks long lines, but uses space instead of tab as indentation.  However, the codingstyle document also from the kernel source indicates no space is allowed for indentation.  Is there a fix for this problem?  Or the result from lindent(space indentation) is actually allowed in kernel source?  Thanks.
