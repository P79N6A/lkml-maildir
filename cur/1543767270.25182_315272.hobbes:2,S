Done.

Most of that psyco speed up is accelerating subsequent diffs in
difflib, which you probably didn't hit yet.

I can make it some sort of environment variable, sure. I think the
speed is already in a domain where it's not a big deal though. There
are other things to do first, like unifying the merge/commit/update
code.

Yeah, I've got a plan here.

Yep, I'm rather new to actually packaging my Python hacks.
