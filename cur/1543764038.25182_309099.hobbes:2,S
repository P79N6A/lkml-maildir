I understand... Didn't know that worms could attach to the bootloader :-) 
Well, then even fixing this in the bootloader would be too late, if the worm 
could simply replace the bootloader. I guess it's not a kernel-issue then and 
should really be addressed in the boot-up sequence (as long as BIOS vendors 
fail to fix it), be it with or without initrd.
