jfs_fsck reports the errors, but is running read-only.  Did you run it
with "-n"?  In read-write mode, it should "fix" the problem (by removing
the corrupt directory and placing its contents in lost+found).
I've seen a few scattered reports of corrupted directories lately, so
there may be a race in the JFS code that I haven't found yet.  I'd be
interested if anyone has found a reproducible way of causing any JFS
corruption.
Thanks,
