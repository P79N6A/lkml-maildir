Subject: Bugs sitting in the RESOLVED state for more than 2 weeks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

These bugs have been sitting in RESOLVED state for more than 2 weeks, ie
they have fixes, but aren't back in the mainline tree (when they
should move to CLOSED state). If the fixes are back in mainline
already, could the owner close them out? Otherwise, perhaps we
can get those fixes back in?
The Bugzilla interface has been changed so that bugs can now go from the NEW
or ASSIGNED state directly to the CLOSED state.
