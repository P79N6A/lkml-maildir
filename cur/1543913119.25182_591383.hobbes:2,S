Please point me to the unfixed bug reports against Linux/ACPI
that justify the existence of linux-phc and I promise to
do my best to fix them.  If they do not exist today,
then please file them.
I believe that linux-phc is alarmingly dangerous code
and I'm willing to invest my time to make it unnecessary.
thanks,
