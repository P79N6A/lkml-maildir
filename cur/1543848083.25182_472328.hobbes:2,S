There are two problems; see below for the testcase covering both
.macro a x
	.byte 1
.endm
	a.x
	a %(a0)+
Old binutils (i.e. what Roman's code expects) treat the above as
	.byte 1
	.byte 1
That behaviour exists in 2.16.1 and earlier.  Everything starting at least
with 2.16.90.0.2 and up to current CVS generates
	Error: Unknown operator -- statement `a.x' ignored
for line 4.  That's the problem dealt with by the first patch (and yes,
current gas from CVS does blow on arch/m68k/math-emu/ as soon as you get
to getuser.l <something>).
_Another_ problem manifests as
	Error: too many positional arguments
in line 5.  That had been introduced later (in 2.16.91.0.3, if you look at
versions on kernel.org, or 2005-08-08 in mainline) and had been fixed since
then (2.16.91.0.7 or 2006-02-28 in CVS).  That's what the second patch
dealt with and yes, I agree that just slapping "don't use those versions
of binutils" in Documentation/Changes is a better variant.
The first problem still needs to be dealt with.
