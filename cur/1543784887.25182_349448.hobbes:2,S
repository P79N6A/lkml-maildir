The embedded systems we use have a "home-made" `init` that
does everything in the coded order. This means that there is
no shell so the system can't be hacked in the usual ways.
Also, some technician in "final test" can't forget to do
something that results in a disaster once a system is in
the field. If the system runs, it's running in its intended
manner.
