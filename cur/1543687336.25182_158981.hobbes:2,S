/me giggles like a 12 year old girl (teehee)
Try an earlier version of blender and you'll see it goes away. Other ones to 
try are opening a gpg signed mail (like this mail) in kmail. The slower the 
sleep avg decay in any tree the longer the spin. Nick's changes I believe 
cover up the flaw. I'm not discounting Nick's work, but I do believe the apps 
are broken and it's only the current scheduler design that makes it visible. 
I would also like to make it impossible for priority inversion to happen but 
at the moment I've just got to make sure they dont starve anything but their 
dependent cpu hog. Still looking for some useful task dependency tracking.
