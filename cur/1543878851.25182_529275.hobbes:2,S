Yeah, and easy to get out of sync.  I'll drop them.

Yes, VMI has 1000 hps.

Debug info, I can remove it.

Actually, I'm not so sure.  If clockevents simply masks the PIT when 
disabling it, we still have overhead of keeping the latch in sync, which 
requires a timer at the PIT frequency.  I can instrument to see how 
exactly the PIT gets disabled.

We need to cancel all pending PIT timer events and restart then local 
timer, which requires atomically taking over IRQ-0.  We use the IDT gate 
for IRQ-0 because it is already an exclusive interrupt, but we can't 
re-use the LVTT IDT gate for local timer since that requires a custom 
custom SMP interrupt in entry.S.  So we must be absolutely sure when we 
get an interrupt on IRQ-0 that it came from the VMI local (rather than 
PIT) delivery path.

Which structure has a ->startup function we can use?  Sorry if this 
seems ignorant, I'm not quite sure what you mean.

It wasn't clear that clockevents would issue a resume notify for us; if 
so we could handle this setup in the callback, but it has to be done on 
the correct CPU.  I can try it and see if that works.
