Well there can be no guarantees - there will always be a race between
flush and hot unplug. If we're careful with write ordering, we can
perhaps arrange to avoid the worst sorts of corruption, provided the
device does the right thing when it's in the middle of an IO.
But generally I think this is a good idea as it shrinks the window.
