Hmm, well, if VMI is happy, Xen is happy, and lguest is happy, then
perhaps we're better off with a cc-only clobber rule?  Certainly makes
life simpler.

Well, I don't think we need such hacks: since we have to use handcoded
asm and mark the callsites anyway, marking what they're calling is
trivial.
The other idea from "btfixup" is that we can do the patching *much*
earlier, so we don't need the initial code to be valid at all if we
wanted to: we just need room to patch in a call insn.  We could then
generate trampolines which do the necessary pushes & pops automatically
for backends which want to use C calling conventions.
Perhaps it's time for code and benchmarks?
Rusty.
