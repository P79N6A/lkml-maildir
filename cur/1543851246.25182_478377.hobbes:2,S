True.  That should read:
 When we remount a filesystem or invalidate a block device which has a
 mounted filesystem we call shrink dcache_sb which currently:
     - moves a collection of dentries to the end of the dentry_unused list
     - calls prune_dcache to prune that number of dentries.
but the patch is still valid.
Any objections to it going in to -mm  and maybe .20 ??
Thanks,
