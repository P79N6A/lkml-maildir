Its not normally a good idea to take a Linus bet, but this time Im obviously
missing something. fd0-2 will be passed in (and if not then shit already
happens - see old bugtraq on the matter for setuid apps, glibc bugs)
So the C library gets fd 3
My first fopen gets fd 4.
That can already happen and isnt new. Several profiling libraries on Unix have
precisely this effect already. They dynamic link/loader will also open file
handles to do mmaps although generally you wont see those as they are closed
again after mapping. 
Internationalisation code in glibc will also open and map tables during startup
