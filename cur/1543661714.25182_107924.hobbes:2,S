That looks more like it.
My guess is that the command slot was emptied previously, but I don't
understand enough about the mailbox specifics of the isp1020 to be sure.
Can you try adding
if(!Cmnd) {
	printk(KERN_ERR "isp1020 Cmnd is NULL for slot %d, out_ptr %d\n",
cmd_slot, out_ptr);
	continue;
}
Just below the Cmnd = hostdata->cmd_slots[cmd_slot];

No, I'm afraid not.  That was just the elimination of those fields from
Scsi_Cmnd so now it has to be indirect through cmnd->device.  It won't
compile without this.
