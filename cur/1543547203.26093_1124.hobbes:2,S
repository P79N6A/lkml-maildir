This is just my lack of experiance talking, but here's the deal...
I have a VIA chipset that supports UDMA66.
the HD also supports it....
bla bla bla..
how do i know that linux is using the drive in UDMA66 mode?
I do get the message at bootup:
ide0: VIA Bus-Master (U)DMA Timing Config Success
But that could be UDMA16 for all i know....
How do i know what mode it's in?
