   Yes, very true.  I think the difference is that in my current
implementation, objects are evaluated on read.  This makes it terribly
easy to do the wrong thing "Hmm, I wonder what that file does... oops".
Evaluating on write would set the bar a little higher, but still has
some of the same issues.  In theory, I definitely agree, the interface
shouldn't need to hide anything.  (I'm sure there are ACPI firmware
folks frightened by that idea)  Thanks,
