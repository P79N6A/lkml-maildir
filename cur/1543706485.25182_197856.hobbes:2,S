Hi Andrew,
Thanks for your quick response..
Yes, the software prepares SCSI commands and sends them down via generic
device driver SG. In our case the device file for related to device
connected(LTO-2 FC interface tape drive) is "/dev/sg0".
I have logged list of CDB the software sends to a device using SG driver and
the attached the same. The log shows that the last CDB was Receive
diagnostic command. I ran multiple times the software, but the SCSI command
that failed was the same.
Please let me know if you need any information.
Best regards,
Veeresh

One of the scatter-gather entries of a SCSI command was NULL.  Is any
of the software you are running preparing SCSI commands and sending
them down via SG perhaps?  What type of I/O is occuring when the
failure occurs?
