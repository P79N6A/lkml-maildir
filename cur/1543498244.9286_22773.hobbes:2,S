Ok, consider this scenario:
(1) Some application is using device files over NFS. [If this isn't
happening, there's no problem with 64 bit device numbers.] Let's use
your "exporting root to legacy machines" case...
(2) The system uses SCSI. [This is an example where 64 bit device
numbers might be good.]
(3) The NFS server gets taken down for a few minutes and disks get added
to it.  [This is the case where the semantics of the device numbers
become significant.]
NFS semantics suggest that the application freeze while the server
is unavailable, and everything continue on after it comes back up.
