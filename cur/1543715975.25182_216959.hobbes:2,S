This is expected. Since the IBM x440/x445 are NUMA systems, we cannot
use the TSC (cpu cycle counter) as a time source. Instead we use an off
chip performance counter which runs at 100Mhz. This then translates to a
bogoMIPS value of ~200.

These posts are about an old bug in 2.4 that was related to the
performance counter time source on the x44x systems. However in those
cases, bogoMIPS would be mis-calculated to ~3, which caused problems.
This issue does not affect 2.6 or recent 2.4 kernels.
