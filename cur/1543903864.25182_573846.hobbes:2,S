It looks like sched_class->enqueue_task() is NULL and that's why the
system hangs ..
The reason why that happens is because check_pgt_cache() is called from
the idle thread, and with PREEMPT_RT check_pgt_cache() locks at least
one mutex .. Once the idle thread is on a wait_list, as soon as it's
woke by the mutex owner the system will crash in enqueue_task. Since the
idle thread has a NULL sched_class->enqueue_task ..
check_pgt_cache() is already getting called from the desched_thread() ,
so I think it could just be removed from i386 cpu_idle().
Anyone have comments on the theory above?
