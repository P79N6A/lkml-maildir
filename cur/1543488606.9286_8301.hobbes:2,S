Hello all!
The symptoms described below are for a Pentium machine, both for the
2.2.2 & 2.2.2-ac7 kernel. This is a RH5.2 system with all updates
installed, including these relative to kernel-2.2. This machine mounts
directories from a hp-ux 10.10 NFS server, but I don't believe hpux is
responsible as I read a similar message in the mailing list with a
Linux NFS server. My PC and the hp-ux box have talking together
happily since the 1.2.13 days. The 2.2.2 & 2.2.2-ac7 are the first 2.2
kernel I install
the directory is mounted as :
lsh03:/disc4 on /nfs/disc4 type nfs (rw,wsize=8192,rsize=8192,addr=134.206.55.3)
The main problem is that it is impossible to execute a.out binaries
from a NFS mounted directories. 
1008 $ /usr/local/lib/texmf/bin/i486-linux/X11/R5/xdvi
bash: /usr/local/lib/texmf/bin/i486-linux/X11/R5/xdvi: cannot execute binary file
1009 $ file /usr/local/lib/texmf/bin/i486-linux/X11/R5/xdvi
/usr/local/lib/texmf/bin/i486-linux/X11/R5/xdvi: Linux/i386 demand-paged executable (ZMAGIC), stripped
The error is accompagnied by two lines in /var/log/messages:
Mar  5 10:16:47 platon kernel: N_TXTOFF < BLOCK_SIZE. Please convert binary.
Mar  5 10:16:47 platon modprobe: can't locate module binfmt-0064
The first line obviously comes from line 331 binfmt_aout.c:
	if (N_MAGIC(ex) == ZMAGIC && ex.a_text &&
	    (fd_offset < bprm->dentry->d_inode->i_sb->s_blocksize)) {
		printk(KERN_NOTICE "N_TXTOFF < BLOCK_SIZE. Please convert binary.\n");
		return -ENOEXEC;
	}
I know binfmt--0064 in the second line is binfmt_aout, but I am
puzzled by the fact that the a.out binfmt is compiled into the
kernel (+ the fact that the first line seems to contradict the second one).
I know nobody should be running a.out programs anymore, and that I
should consider upgrading my TeX distribution, but I report this
problem in case it unveils a more serious bug. After all, nobody
should type ldd core either :-)
Finally, I regularly get these errors (both with 2.2.2 & 2.2.2-ac7): 
Mar  5 09:45:40 platon kernel: NFS: server lsh03, readdir reply truncated
Mar  5 09:45:40 platon kernel: NFS: nr=164, slots=2, len=7
I hope this is useful
Marc.
