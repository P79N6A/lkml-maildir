Here's a potential serial problem with 2.2.14. It also still appears to
exist in 2.3.99-pre3.
In drivers/char/serial.c:transmit_chars() there is:
        count = info->xmit_fifo_size;
        do {
                serial_out(info, UART_TX,
info->xmit_buf[info->xmit_tail++]);
                info->xmit_tail = info->xmit_tail & (SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE-1);
                info->state->icount.tx++;
                if (--info->xmit_cnt <= 0)
                        break;
        } while (--count > 0);
However info->xmit_fifo_size is set to 16 for a 16550A, and the FIFO
threshold for speeds of 2400bps and above is 8. And it calls
transmit_chars() when the threshold is reached. This would mean the FIFO
would get overrun if it ever rose above the threshold and there were more
than 8 more chars waiting to be sent.
Is my analysis correct? If so, I would have thought more people would have
noticed :-/. Please CC me on replies, thanks.
