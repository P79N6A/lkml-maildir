Note that writepage() doesn't get used much.  Most VM-initiated
filesystem writeback activity is via try_to_release_page(), which
has somewhat more vague and flexible semantics.
And by bdflush, which I suspect tends to conflict with sync_page_buffers()
under pressure.  But that's a different problem.
