How?  OK, there are some tasks, that read and/or write /dev/fuse. And
there are some that just communicate in some way with the above.
These could all be considered "fuse tasks", but those that don't do
I/O on /dev/fuse are indistinguishable from non-fuse tasks.
And for example sshfs does have such a thread, which is in the reply
chain, yet never communicates directly with the fuse kernel module.
