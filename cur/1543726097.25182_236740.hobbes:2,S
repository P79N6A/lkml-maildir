Well it isn't that you depend on kswapd, but that your task gets called
into via page reclaim (to facilitate page reclaim). In which case having
the task block in memory allocation can cause a deadlock.
The solution is that PF_MEMALLOC tasks are allowed to access the reserve
pool. Dependencies don't matter to this system. It would be your job to
ensure all tasks that might need to allocate memory in order to free
memory have the flag set.

OK.
