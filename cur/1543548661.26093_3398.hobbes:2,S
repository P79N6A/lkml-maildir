Matti,
  if you are maintaining such table, you can add
      NCPfs:    protocol is limited to 4G-1, Linux implementation to 2G-1
I do not plan any change until Novell discloses 64bit NCP file api.
                                            Best regards,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
