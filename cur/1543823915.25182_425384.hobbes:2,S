This can only happen if someone disables the interrupts for too long and 
then calls get_offset_pit(). As soon as the timer interrupt had a chance 
to run, time is advanced and everything should be fine.
IMO it's not worth it to support such misbehaviour.

We should at least add a warning that the clock is not usable for precise 
timekeeping (in the resolution limits one would expect from it).
In the UP case we can live without the underflow information, if we assume 
the function is called with interrupts enabled and it's properly restarted 
in case of an underflow via the timer interrupt. If we do this, we also 
have to document this somewhere that it relies on the current seq_lock 
bevaviour.
I guess in the SMP IO-APIC case we can't do much more than print the 
warning and make sure the time doesn't go backwards as you suggested.
If the underflow information is usable from the PIC, we could make proper 
use of it as I suggested and this had the advantange it's safe to use with 
interrupts disabled and doesn't require retrying. Although to make it safe 
for SMP it would also require synchronisation with the interrupt 
acknowledgement.
Anyway, the current underflow handling is next to useless, so I guess it's 
better to remove it and just document the current limitations. If someone 
cares enough, he can then do an alternative offset function properly using 
the information from the PIC.
