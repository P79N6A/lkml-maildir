First, since when?  Postal mail, yes.  But when did that happen for
email?
Second, it wasn't clear to me whether this was a case of someone
intercepting someone else's mail and sending it to an autoresponder,
or someone foolishly setting up their own autoresponder.  If rerouting
your own mail is a crime, I think most people on this list will be in
serious trouble.
