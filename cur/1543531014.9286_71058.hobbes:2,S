The versions supporting EDD use either "EDD" or "LBA32" to enable this
mode. "LINEAR" still has the old behaviour, for the reason you mention.
"LINEAR" tells LILO not to try to understand the geometry before boot
time. This will work around problems caused by the kernel guessing a
different geometry than the BIOS. However, it does _not_ solve the
problem of exceeding 1024 cylinders in the BIOS geometry. In fact, it
makes it worse, because you won't find out before the system tries to
boot and fails. Only EDD is an adequate solution in such cases (if
available and implemented correctly; otherwise, you're out of luck).
