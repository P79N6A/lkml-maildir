Hi
I have the same problem with my synaptics touchpad (CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2) as 
mentioned in
"Do not use synaptics extensions by default" thread from 2004-01-10
10:10:16 PST
in 2.6.1 the problem is unchanged. The thing is I dont understand if it
is considered as "normal" behaviour and I have to change my X config, or
boot parameters or something.
Didn't found anything in docs.
