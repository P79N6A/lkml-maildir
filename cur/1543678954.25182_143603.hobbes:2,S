It was indeed private mail and it's a little annoying to see it posted
because it drags other people's private comments into the mix.  On the
other hand it pretty much validates the decision to procmail him.

You're barred from interacting with me.  I can't speak for the rest of the
company but I suspect they don't want to discuss business models with
you.  But I'm sure they'll answer your BK questions if any.
I'd be happy to hear from you too if there was any forward progress but 
we've gone around and around enough.  Best of luck, as I tried to say 
it isn't personal, it is a time saving thing.  I'm just as stubborn as
you and if I see your mail I'll respond.  So I procmail out the people
that don't seem to want to listen and I suspect that most people like
it because it reduces noise on the list.
