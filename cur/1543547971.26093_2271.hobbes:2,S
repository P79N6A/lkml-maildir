if you're lucky and can analyse the crash online, maybe.  but offline
crash dump analysis is the only option for a mission critical system with
terabytes of attached data... you know, those problems you can never
reproduce in testing, but are guaranteed to happy monday morning when
everyone comes back from the weekend and slams the net.  as much as i
dislike solaris and veritas, i have to give their engineers credit for
working from 6Gb crash dumps and responding with patches a few days later.
(i'd put the word "enterprise" up there, but too many folks think it's
just marketing... until they actually have to deal in that realm :)
ObDebuggerReligion:  i favour debuggers.  i frequently learn how code is
structured by walking into it with a debugger... i do this even when i
want to add features rather than fix bugs.  a debugger is a tool, it can't
think for you; you're still in control.
