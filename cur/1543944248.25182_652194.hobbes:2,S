Fairly obvious fixes.

Sounds sane enough.  But I do have some reservations about the
implementation.  It would be best if you split the patch in two.  One
with the obvious stuff above and one for this.
The core of remove_device_by_name() is shared with block2mtd_exit(),
so a common helper would be good.  Your error handling is better, so
let's keep that version.
And independently of your patch a mutex protecting the device list from
simultaneous modifications would be good to have.
Side note: I may not have internet access until 19th or so.
