No, I don't. I don't even have the wanpipe card. But can you explain what
have been gained when these fields got removed ? Someone with such a card
could test it before. No matter hardly someone does, but it could. And one
could use the card with something less esoteric. Now the driver is broken
and the card can't be used at all. Not only for IPX over X.25. What is the
goal ? What has this been done for ?
