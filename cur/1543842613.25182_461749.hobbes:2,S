I do.  As I recall the history | and & predate the introduction
of || and && and originally served both functions, so the got
the lower precedence.

You see my point :)  I have better things to worry about
when writing and reviewing code than remember what the
precedence rules are.
Anyway I have figured out how to remove the need for the - 1,
and the trailing empty entries in proc, patch to follow shortly.
