And now I've noticed that when that prority stops fluctuating, it stops
forever. Running the DD test again and again doesn't change anything!
For some reasons (running time?) the trancode priority is stuck to 16
and DD always performs very badly: ~50s (normally it should be 8s).
When I've noticed this the real running time of the trancode test is
about 35/40 min.
