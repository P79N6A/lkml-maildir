Not exactly, but there is an optimization in cpp that makes it
possible to do the cleanup Linus wants without sacrificing
performance. From the cpp info pages:
        The GNU C preprocessor is programmed to notice when a header
        file uses this particular construct and handle it efficiently.
        If a header file is contained entirely in a `#ifndef'
        conditional, modulo whitespace and comments, then it remembers
        that fact.  If a subsequent `#include' specifies the same
        file, and the macro in the `#ifndef' is already defined, then
        the directive is skipped without processing the specified file
        at all.
I did an strace on cpp to verify that this optimization actually
works.
