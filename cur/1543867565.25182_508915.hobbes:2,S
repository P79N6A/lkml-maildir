But, what do you do with Oracle that's asking maxfiles to be set to 
0x10000, while the default value might be enough for a system that's not 
running Oracle.
I'm afraid that giving boot time values to the max_* tunables we will 
loose all the benefits from /proc (or /sys): it is impossible to 
anticipate what an OS will be used for. So allowing such things to be 
changed without having to reboot the machine is in my mind quite a 
powerful feature we should keep taking adavntage of.
