 As Greg suggested, make your hotplug handler wait for the files to
 appear and you are set.
 Actually "sleep 1" will generally do the trick.
 What can actually be a problem is that hotplug delays event handling
 while booting, and if firmware needing drivers load at boot time they
 usually timeout before the event gets handled, and when hotplug tryies
 to handle the event the files are already gone.
 The only solution I see to the later is making the default timeout much
 bigger and  maybe having hotplug reset it to a shorter value once it
 starts handling events.

 There are actually some oopses, which I believe come from incorrect
 refcounting in sysfs, when I get around to looking at it I'll also
 audit "use after free" issues with firmware_priv struct.

 The hotplug handler runs as root, and if buggy enough it could write a
 broken firmware image anyway, or write to /dev/mem or whatever, I don't
 see a point in this level of paranoia.

 I am currently on Xmas vacation, until January I won't be very
 responsive.
 Have a nice day
