Sure, this is why I propose to disable that option by default in 
distribution kernels, so it would produce no harm. ISCSI-SCST can work 
in this configuration quite well too. People who need both iSCSI target 
*and* fast working user space device handlers would simply enable that 
option and rebuild the kernel. Rejecting this patch provides much worse 
alternative: those people would also have to *patch* the kernel at 
first, only then enable that option, then rebuild the kernel. (I'm 
repeating it to make sure you didn't miss this my point; it was in the 
part of my original message, which you cut out.)
Thanks,
