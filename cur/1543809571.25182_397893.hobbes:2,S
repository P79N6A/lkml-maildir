Hello,
I understand that every system call is a cancellation point for pthreads. My question is how can I avoid this to happen; meaning- to forbid the cancellation point in the system call wrapper. (I call a system call from a cleanup function that is just been cancelled) 
I tried to avoid it by setting pthread_setcancelstate (PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, &old_state); before calling the system call, but than if the thread had been cancelled the process just stuck.
Thanks for the help.
