Just a 'me too!' but I'm inclined to think 'rsync bug' because it happens
on Redhat+2.4.x, Debian+2.4.x and Debian+2.2.18 - we finally gave up on
rsync for big-stuff-site-to-site and went back to scp. (It was -way-
faster to scp 4 gigs than to rsync the 50 megs or so of changes. It would
run, then freeze (usually at different places - if it froze twice in the
same place we'd just scp the file manually), so we'd wander past and
kill/restart it, repeat. Fastest total was 4 days, where the two of us
checked it every couple of hours over the weekend.)
We're (trying to) using it in real-life-big-data environment, so if you
need debuggers/more info/etc let me know. 
(I'm on LKML but not rsync-bugs, so cc me from that side.. thanks!)
