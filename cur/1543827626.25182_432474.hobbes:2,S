Probably over enthusiastic gcc inlining.  gcc 4 will inline functions
that are not declared as inline.  That is not so bad, except that some
versions of gcc will ignore a mismatch in function attributes and
inline a __init function into normal text, generating additional
section mismatches.  For a specific example, see
