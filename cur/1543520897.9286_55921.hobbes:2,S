That is no bug, it's intended to be so! Just read the relevant header file
<asm/page.h>:
...
 * A __PAGE_OFFSET of 0xC0000000 means that the kernel has
 * a virtual address space of one gigabyte, which limits the
 * amount of physical memory you can use to about 950MB. If
 * you want to use more physical memory, change this define.
