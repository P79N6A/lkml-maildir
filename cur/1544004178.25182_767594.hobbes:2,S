Could you try the patch below?
There is another patch for a missing capture mux control, but in your
case, it doesn't matter because you didn't change the value.
I'll post that patch later, too.
thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda - Fix input pin initialization for STAC/IDT codecs
The input pins are sometimes not initialized properly because
of the optimization check of the current pinctl code.
Force to initialize the mic input pins so that they can be set up
properly even if they were in a weird state.  But keep other input
pins if already set up as input, since this could be an extra mic
pin.
