Well I strongly dissagre with you - I need to know about all thread -
when I'm
developing my application and it crashes then sometimes thread which
has crashed is undetectable because of completely broken stack (C++
destructors)
 - but because I could inspect other threads I know which thread caused
segfault
(also I know in which state other thread have been - locked in mutex or
similar)
So if you think core dumps are garbage - use ulimit and you want ever
see them.
But for me I need all threads - and I like the behaviour of -ac kernel.
