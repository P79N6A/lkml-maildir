In 2.0.x it was possible to go upper than chrooted directory doing 'cd
/proc/1/root' for example. Seems it is fixed in 2.2.x (I tried it with
2.2.9), so this isn't so big problem any more. There are no other way to
exit from chrooted directory.
It isn't hard to show only processes with the same root directory but if
You would see processes chrooted to some subdirectory, it isn't so simple
any more (it needs libc getcwd() like function). But of course You
want it because this is the only way to see chrooted processes outside
chrooted area.
