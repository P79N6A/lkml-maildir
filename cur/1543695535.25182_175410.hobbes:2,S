I keep hearing 'pollutes the global namespace' all the time, now. Do
you mean that 'C' code designers actually intend to use the same
name for different procedures or objects in different files?
If so, that's a problem of idiocy, not pollution. Anybody who
writes code for a living would not do that, now would they??
The fact that there may be many global references that need to
be resolved by the linker is not pollution. It's using tools to
simplify design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
