Bind 8.2.4 was released on May 17th, with the standard
comment "BIND 8.2.4 is the latest version of ISC BIND 8.
We strongly recommend that you upgrade to BIND 9.1 or, if
that is not immediately possible, to BIND 8.2.4 due to
certain security vulnerabilities in previous versions."
However, there are no release notes on ISC's web site,
and their vulnerabilities page lists no known security
flaws in Bind 8.2.3.
But the paranoid part of me does wonder :-)
(And I haven't the time to do the diffs to see what's
changed.)
Cheers,
Phil
