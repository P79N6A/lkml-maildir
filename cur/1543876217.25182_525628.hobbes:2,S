No, I could not get the original patches to apply to any new kernel. They did 
apply to 2.6.20-mm2 with very minimal collisions.
I only applied patches 1/5 and 2/5 of the original series. But now that I look 
into patch 3/5 it seems that it has useful irq allocation things.
Anyway, I think the best way would be to get 2.6.20-rt8 against which the 
original patch series was made. Add all 5 patches from Venkatesh and then try 
with my patch added. I'll try that myself later today.
