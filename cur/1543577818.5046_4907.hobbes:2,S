Release 0.9.1: Sun Jan  7 18:05:36 EST 2001
	* Synchronized with 2.4.0 final.
	* Fixed bugs in handling of -W and -D flags.
	* "source" pathnames are now evaluated relative relative to the 
	  directory of the including file, so it's now possible to compile
	  in a directory other than that of the rules file.
Special thanks to Giacomo Catenazzi, whose persistence about
reporting front-end bugs finally pushed me in the right direction to
find some obscure problems I had never been able to reproduce before.
