I missed the rest of the thread, but if you are talking about what I think
you are talking about, I'll go <AOL>Me too</AOL>
A horrible combination of accidents with scripts that set lilo to boot
to the hibernated partition if last suspended, and an apparent BIOS bug
that allowed me to boot out of a hibernated partition for a second
time meant that my laptop came out of regular hibernation mode (as
opposed to using swsusp for "hibernation") 2 months
after I originally suspended the machine. After I had gone through
numerous kernel upgrades and reboots, and after I had partially
repartioned the drive. Needless to say, there were a number of partitions
that were toast after this issue. Fortunately, I had made a backup of my
drive (including me thesis!) only a week beforehand, and /home was fine.
Not bad concidering the last backup was from 3 months ago!
