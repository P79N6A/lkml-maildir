This is what I've done in some instances.  There should be no harm in
sticking that mkswap into your init scripts right before the swapon -a,
and then you have a nice userspace solution.
It's safe to reinitialize swap on any clean boot.  A resume will not get
into the init scripts.
Just remember you're doing the mkswap if you decide to rearrange your
partitions at all, or code a script smart enough to grep your swap
partitions out of your fstab.
