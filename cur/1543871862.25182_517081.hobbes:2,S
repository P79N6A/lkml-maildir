There already were two kernel releases where people had to say
explicitely "yes" to "Obsolete OSS drivers" with a quite clear help text
for getting these OSS drivers.
And did you complain when all the SATA options were renamed in 2.6.19
without any warnings in previous kernels and far more user-visible 
effects than some obsolete OSS drivers (and no driver for your hard 
disk even prevents booting)?
Or about the mess with the mes with the netfilter options when upgrading 
from 2.6.19 to 2.6.20?
If you didn't, this is the wrong patch to start complaining about...

Printing won't help - there are two many options (some even not user 
visible) that disappear with each kernel release.
