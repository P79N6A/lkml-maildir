Wrong: cdrecord asumes nothing. It is the SCSI Generic transport library libscg.
Note that libscg does not offer access to a block layer device like /dev/hd* 
but rather to the transport layer _below_ /dev/hd*. If you ignore this fact you 
will have problems to understand the rules.

I am not sure whether you understood the problem here. Cdrtools need to deal 
with a lot of vendor specific commands.
