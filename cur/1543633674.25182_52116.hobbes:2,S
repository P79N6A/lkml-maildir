Oh crap, you're right...   eepro100 in general does funky stuff with the 
way packets are handled, mainly due to the need to issue commands to the 
NIC engine instead of the normal per-descriptor owner bit way of doing 
things.
Well, I accept patches to that clean eepro100 up...   I'm not terribly 
motivated to clean it up myself, as we have e100 and an e100 maintainer 
we can beat on if such uglies arise :)
