I no longer have the original, so I will just have to respond to this
one, since it is related.  I know I know nearly nothing about
networking, but here has been my thinking.
David, you believe we don't need NAPI.  You believe we perform fine
without it.  Here is my question.  A PCI bus, IRC, has about 500
Megabytes/sec of bandwidth.  A full blown gigabit Ethernet stream should
be around 133 Megabytes/sec.  Sounds to me like a PC could act easily
(As far as bandwidth is concerned) as a 4 to 5 port gigabit Ethernet
router.
How well does this work with NAPI and how well does it work without?  Is
NAPI a gain here?
Maybe there are other issues involved that I am unaware of, if there
are, I would still like to see how the theoretical answers pan out.
Thank you,
Trever Adams
