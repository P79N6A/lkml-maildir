How do you know what he means when he says "reliability"? He has been
working for a few years on Inferno, which is intended to be a
_reliable_ OS for certain kinds of server applications. No doubt Linux
doesn't have many things which he considers to be important for
reliability. Some of these things we would all think would be
important; others might be considered religious issues.
I really doubt he meant "Linux sucks, it crashes every 5 minutes, and
is just as bad as Windows." But if you want to know, ask him, don't
call an out-of-context-without-details-stray-comment "inaccurate".
