Yan,
        I think your patch has some problems.

        This code is the only place in the current code where you
can generate a group header with an empty source list (what it is
checking for). Your patch has added an add_grhead() for change
and EXCLUDE records, but it isn't checking mca_crcount or isquery.
I need to check, but I'm concerned this will create a group header
in a report for cases where it should not.

        This "truncate" code is to handle exclude records that may be
truncated. It gets a new packet when adding this record and the whole
thing won't fit in a single packet. This is not appropriate for anything
but IS_EX and TO_EX, but "ischange" in your patch will be true for
TO_IN. So, I think this will waste space in a report that could hold
some of these TO_IN sources.
        I haven't run your test code, or tested with your patch yet,
just observing the differences from the original code path and your
patch (and they appear to be more than you intended).
