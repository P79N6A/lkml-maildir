Unfortunately that doesn't work for ocfs2 for exactly the same reasons page
lock doesn't work during a write either - there's a cluster lock inversion
and we might have to zero adjacent pages for an allocating write.
What's involved in merging it with ->fault?
Here's a nasty idea... Would it be valid for ->page_mkwrite to unlock the
page, so long as it's returned in a locked state? Though, do we even need
the page lock that early? It seemed to me that you were adding it for
consistency reasons (I could be wrong though).
