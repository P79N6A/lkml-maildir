One possibly interesting thing for you guys who are trying to reduce 
stack usage is using the SLAB allocator for pagevec structures in the VM
code. mpage_readpages/writepages use those, and pretty much all VM code.
Allocating those structures from SLAB can also increase performance
due to cache colouring, but requires the additional instructions into
kmalloc() for allocation - needs benchmarking.
I want to try so if no one does it before.
