I'm not aware of *any* DBMS, commercial or not, which can perform
meaningful multi-master replication on tables which mainly consist of
text files as records.  All you can get is single-master replication
(which is well-understood), or some rather scary stuff which involves
throwing away updates, or taking extrema or averages (even automatic
3-way merges aren't available).
