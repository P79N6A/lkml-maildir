No, the dependency of this file is currently wrong. In the case of those
tuners, all have the same dependencies: DVB or V4L and I2C. That's the reason
why I've removed the individual dependencies. Yet, two drivers need a select
(xc3028 and xc5000 needs to select FW_LOADER - so, only those two drivers are
also dependent of HOTPLUG).
