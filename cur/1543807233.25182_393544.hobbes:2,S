Fair points, I don't have a firm opinion either, it's entirely up to you
as maintainer.
But I'd be less keen to force the equivalent changes into 2.6.16's sg.c.
Saving sg_pages from get_user_pages fits in quite unobtrusively in st.c,
and its enlarge_buffer/normalize_buffer pages are already safely isolated
from the scatterlist by the separate frp_segs array.  But sg.c presently
uses the scatterlist for the latter case too, so would need more change:
except that, thanks to Mike, we find it doesn't need changing now.
Your suggestion of a comment would be most appropriate there.
(I've not forgotten our outstanding SetPageDirty to set_page_dirty_lock
issue, but still striving to avoid too much nuisance in sg.c's case.)
