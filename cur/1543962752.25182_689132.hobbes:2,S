My current view on this is that per cpu scheduling should use a time
based clock, whereas smp load balancing can take the cycle (ie work)
counter to balance different work/time loads and estimate core power.
As for using the TSC, I'm afraid we just don't have any choice. Although
I guess we could dynamically detect some counter on new cpus and use
that when available. But the TSC is the only thing available on a lot of
existing machines.
