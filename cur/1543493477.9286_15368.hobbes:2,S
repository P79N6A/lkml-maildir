Lucky I just built 2.2.6.  I'm building with your patch right now.  It
was a pain to get it building because your changes to
arch/i386/Makefile broke the pentium & ppro configs for gcc 2.7.2.3 -
this version of gcc doesn't support -mpentium & -mpentiumpro.
BTW, you have 128mb, right?  With my test program you should
experiment with the number of records.  I'd think 120,000 records
should be sufficient to bring the machine to its knees.  240,000
should definitely do it.  At least it would on a 2.0 machine &
probably would on a 2.2 machine.
