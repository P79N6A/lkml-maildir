There are cases where bitmaps can dirty themselves in the FS's (I have 
had to deal with several of these issues in 2.6) after a sync,
and I have found that:
#
# sync
# sync
#
is required on ext2 in some situations due to some race conditions with 
remote and local clients using device based FS's, so
there are some holes -- and comments in ext2 and several other FS's seem 
to bear this assumption out.
