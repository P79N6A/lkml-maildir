Oh, I see. I was missing something then...;-)

Why shouldn't you need it ? It is NUMA generic, and totally arch
independent.
And it actually helps performance. I also allows the kernel to have a
single memory allocation path. I think it is cleaner than calling _alloc_pages()
from numa.c

I hope so  :-)
But your fix is at the same time useless and harmless for UMA machines.
OTOH, the SGI patch doesn't modify __alloc_pages(). I think I'm a little
too picky here...
Cheers,
Samuel.
