Hello,
Running a dell poweredge 1650 with two intel e1000/pro's on redhat 7.3.
We seem to be having a problem with the ethernet cards linking at 100 mbps/FDX 
and only working for a few seconds (usually around 30 seconds). There are no 
messages in dmesg other than when the module is loaded (Stating that port0 is 
up at 100 mbs/FDX). Is this a known issue, and is there a workaround? I can 
provide more information if needed.
Thanks,
-Joe Kellner
