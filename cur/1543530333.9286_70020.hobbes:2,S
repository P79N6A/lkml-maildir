I really doubt that's true.

No, there's 4M of _completely_ free RAM, and alot of RAM being used for disk
buffers.  The VM system thinks that disk is more likely to be referenced soon
than the memory it swapped out, so it prefers to keep them in RAM.

How fast can you replace the disk pages that are in cache if they weren't there?

Yes, but not as frequently as you're using that disk cache, so without the
swap you will be waiting on disk _more_.
A typical machine has a lot of processes that will sit unused for days or
weeks - a small amount of swap means that you get more RAM, usually for
cache.  On my main work machine, 34 of 86 processes are essentially completely
swapped out - gettys on unused VCs, tcsh processes in xterms I haven't
touched in ages, a couple GNOME apps that are buried beyond everything.
Without that 17M of RAM that the swap buys me, this machine would be a lot
less responsive.  Yes, if I suddenly started typing in one of those windows
there would be a second of delay while it got swapped back in, but if I
didn't have disk cache it would delay every time I ran "ls".
