I would prefer to put a dev_warn() line here, so that people reading
the kernel log can easily tell which device caused the problem and what
sort of problem it is.  Something like this:
		dev_warn(dev, "device added while parent %s is asleep\n",
				dev->parent->bus_id);
		WARN_ON(true);

Again, a dev_warn() would be appropriate.
And you might consider taking out the "error = -EAGAIN" and the
"break".  When this occurs it doesn't mean that devices were suspended
in the wrong order; it means that the ordering of the parent pointers
fails to match the ordering of dpm_active.  The only way for this to
happen is if the parent pointers are messed up by device_move() --
dpm_active will still be correct.
The rest of the patch looks fine.
