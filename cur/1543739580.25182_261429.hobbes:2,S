3 possibilities: (there are more, including some with industrial 
protection, isolation, etc.)
www.computerboards.com : PCI-DIO24 and PCI-DIO24H, $89.  These are 
basically a single 8255 connected to the bus through a PCI glue chip.  
They don't seem to provide a driver, but I would think the board would 
be set up automatically by the PCI code, and then there are just the 
standard 4 ports to read/write (you just have to find the base address 
theough the PCI subsystem).
www.ni.com : NI-PCI-6503, $145.  This is a 24 I/O board, but has added 
logic (like a programmable power-on I/O state).  There don't seem to be 
Linux drivers, but they may exist if you ask tech support.  (NI is 
fairly Linux-friendly - they made a LabView/Linux version).
www.byterunner.com : PCI-1284-P2, $39.95.  This is a dual IEEE1284 PCI 
parallel port card, with Linux drivers.  It's not quite what you're 
looking for, but it will give you 24 I/O's (16 bidir, 10 dedicated, 2 
interrupts).
Hope this helps
