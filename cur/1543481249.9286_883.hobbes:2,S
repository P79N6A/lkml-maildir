I guess I'm not sure what you mean by an interuppted system call then.
in what cases will a read for example get interupted?
I think I must be missing something (it's probably obvious, but I've
been staring at way too much windows code today).

That's why I said win32... most apps have to target 95/98/NT these
days, so using the native kernel API isn't practical (it also
isn't documented worth a damn -- best docs I have seen are from the
reverse engineering work from the sys internal's folks and the like)

Yes, if it does prove that it would be best in the kernel, then so be
it.
the best place principle is a good one, but I think if it is a tie
between user 
and kernel, we should go user.
