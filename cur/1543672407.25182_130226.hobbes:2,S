No, but clearly something is wrong. At least that you should agree on.
And knowing hardware, there are probably drives out there that just wont
work because of the various "weird" commands it gets sent.
Just because it happens to work for you doesn't make it a viable
solution.

Shouldn't matter, the drive has to check for that particular bit (and it
obviously does not). Are we still talking 2.5 or 2.4?

You can play with the c code, you've demonstrated that much so far. So
play some more, find out which commands are aborted and why. The log
messages even tell you which ones. Now find out if these are necessary
for proper MO functionality or not. Or maybe some vital commands are
even missing, lots of fun there :). But it really should not be very
hard.
