Intel's new XSC3 ARM core supports up to 36-bit addressing and 
they have several CPUs based on this that are already out or will
be released in the next year. I can currently get around 64-bit
resources by playing ugly tricks with the memory map and trapping
ioremap() calls to a certain unused 32-bit physical range and fixing 
it up to 64-bit (like PPC440?? does) but that may not work on future
CPUs that don't have holes in the memmap.
> * How many 32-bit systems support a 64-bit PCI address space?
This is a fairly common thing on some of the Intel XScale I/O and
network processors. Some of the Intel CPUs provide a window in 
32-bit CPU that translates to 64-bit PCI space.
> * Should ioremap and variants start taking 64-bit physical addresses?
If we are to use 64 bit resources, then yes. Or pfns...
Do a google for my real opinion on this. I think ioremap() should take 
a device and resource describing the address of the resources in the
address space of the device (the bus it is one). The whole resource 
and I/O subwystem currently assumes that physical and PCI bus address 
spaces are one and the same, but I have HW that breaks this assumption 
by allowing up to 2 GB of RAM and 3GB of PCI devices. Whenever this
has been brought up though, Linus has shot it down. What we need is
a real concept of per-bus address spaces and resources. But that is
far more complicated change.

Probably the best thing to do b/c on really small systems that 
don't have 64-bit needs, we'll just be wasting memory with the
extra data structure size. We need to scale down to PCI systems
with just 8MB of RAM.
