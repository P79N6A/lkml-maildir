To be fair that warning doesn't trigger on some platforms, such as
sparc64 where the __get_cpu_var() implementation simply takes the
value from a fixed cpu register and doesn't do the debugging check.
Sparc64 should add the check when debugging options are enabled, for
sure, but the point is that it may not entirely be the tester's fault.
