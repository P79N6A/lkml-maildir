Mostly support question, sent to kernel list because of confusion with
mc_forwarding being set as read only.
I've been working on a Linux PPTP VPN server for clients that require
multicasting. I only have one physical interface in the box and I'm using
the PoPToP package for PPTP support. Getting the VPN setup and working
hasn't been a problem, getting the multicast traffic to flow between the ppp
and eth0 interface is causing me a whole lot of problems. What do I need to
do so that I can tell the kernel to forward all relevant multicast traffic
through to the clients (in essence just a simple IGMP router)? I've been
looking at mrouted, pimd-dense and mrtd but haven't had any luck getting
them to work because of the dynamic nature of the PPP interfaces.
My backup is a W2K server which I've had some luck getting to work but I
would really hate to use it unless I need to because there is a huge
political battle raging right now about Linux being a sub standard OS.
Thanks.
