Hi All,
Updated patch for MMU-less CPU support uClinux-2.5.35uc0.patch.gz
is at:
   
http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/uClinux-2.5.x
I am thinking about breaking this up into a few separate
patches as well. Logically there is a parts that fit
together separately (new ethernet driver, new fb, etc).
I'll try and get that out soon...
Regards
Greg
