Please don't do this. Using the same name for a branch as for a tag is 
madness. Call it "v2.6.20-stable" or anything else, but don't re-use the 
same naming as for tags.
Sure, git will have some random well-defined order of parsing which one 
"v2.6.20" actually means in any particular context (usually the tag-name 
will take precedence, except for contexts where the branchname is 
required!), and yeah, you can always make things unambiguous by specifying 
the full name (ie say "[refs/]tags/v2.6.20" when you want to make sure 
it's unambiguously the tag, not the branch) but it's still guaranteed to 
cause confusion at *some* level, if only for the user.
So just don't do it.
