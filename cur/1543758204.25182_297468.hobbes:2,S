OK.  It would be good to have a phase 0: any refactoring, abstracting, etc
to the core kernel and to i386 which is a preparatory step, prior to
introducing any Xen code.  After phase 0 everything should still compile
and run.  The subsequent Xen patches should merely add stuff and not move
existing code around.

What would you propose doing with the i386 header files?  Such as the
pagetable handling?

It sounds decent.  The main objective is to minimise code duplication.  The
question of where in the tree all the resulting code actually lands is
secondary from a maintainability POV.
