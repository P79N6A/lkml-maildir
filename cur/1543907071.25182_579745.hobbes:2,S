Hi,
If there are no other plans of kconfig docs update I think this
message of yours should be useful enough. I made minimal fixes,
so if they are wrong or you prefer it otherwise, I'm OK with any
change to this proposal, including replacement with something
else.
Thanks & regards,
Jarek P.

 - reverse dependencies: "select" <symbol> ["if" <expr>]
   While normal dependencies reduce the upper limit of a symbol (see
   below), reverse dependencies can be used to force a lower limit of
   another symbol. The value of the current menu symbol is used as the
   minimal value <symbol> can be set to. If <symbol> is selected multiple
   times, the limit is set to the largest selection.
   Reverse dependencies can only be used with boolean or tristate
   symbols.
+  Note:
+	select is evil.... select will by brute force set a symbol
+	equal to 'y' without visiting the dependencies. So abusing
+	select you are able to select a symbol FOO even if FOO depends
+	on BAR that is not set. In general use select only for
+	non-visible symbols (no promts anywhere) and for symbols with

 - numerical ranges: "range" <symbol> <symbol> ["if" <expr>]
   This allows to limit the range of possible input values for int
   and hex symbols. The user can only input a value which is larger than
   or equal to the first symbol and smaller than or equal to the second
   symbol.
