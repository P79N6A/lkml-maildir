Hello,
as of 2.6.25-rc1, there is no more /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video1 which
controlled LVDS backlight on Lenovo ThinkPad T61. There is still acpi_video0
which seems to have sane values but echo N > brightness has no effect at all.
thinkpad_acpi module reports that ACPI controlled backlight is present.
