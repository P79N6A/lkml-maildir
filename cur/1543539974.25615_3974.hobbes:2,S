I'm new to this list and don't know too much about driver programming,
but I had similar problems writing some assembly programs years ago.
My problems were mainly caused by doing 16-bit access to 8-bit registers.
The CPU-/Chipset does some automatic serialisation of those requests, but
sometimes the timing is critical. For my problems it helped to split the
requests into 8-bit io's with some NOP's in between ...
