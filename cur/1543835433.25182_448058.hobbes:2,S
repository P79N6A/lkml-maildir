Thanks for the comments. They are appreciated even though the module never 
will be submitted to the kernel.

Hmm... These I can't see.. For me trailing WS can be two things; WS between 
the last real character and newline and empty lines at the end of the file. I 
hate these two cases of trailing WS myself and I can't see any of them in the 
patch, so what is it I'm missing here? (Ok, I see one space at the beginning 
of one line, but that's not 'a lot' so it can't be that.)

I should have put a note on this. It is something that enables me to force X 
to fail to open and to read from the device. That way it will be possible to 
reload the module without restarting X. Useful while developing and would 
have been removed if I ever would have released it to the kernel.

Yes, that would be the correct behavior. It could however result in some 
inconsistent behavior. As applications that open the device before attaching 
the tablet succeeds, and applications that opens it after the tablet is 
attached will fail (if input_open_device fails as well).
Maybe only opening the device when connecting it or if it is the first one 
that opens it would be the best way to handle it?

The above code is called when a new tablet is added/removed so it's not 
possible to return something 'nice'. It might not even be the newly attached 
tablet that it fails to open. So in this case is it really possible to do 
anything else than a printk?
Thanks
