Subject: [patch 05/19] ACPI: Include apic.h

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
apic.h does not get included on UP compiles.
That way the APICTIMER_STOPS_ON_C3 is not there and UP boxen have no support
for timer broadcasting. This was never noticed, because the lapic timer is 
only used for profiling on UP.
