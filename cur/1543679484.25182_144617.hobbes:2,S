Hello All,
I have a question to definition from nls.h (both 2.4.21 and 2.5.56):
The utf-8 decoding stuff seems to handle all characters up to
0x7fff_ffff. But then it supposes to store them in wchar_t and it is
defined as __u16. To me it seems like a bug (which should moreover be
trivial to fix with something like:)
