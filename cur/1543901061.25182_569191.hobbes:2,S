Subject: signalfd() semantics after execve()

Davide, 
I'm working on the signalfd(2) man page, and I've come
acorss some puzzling behaviour...  
What are the intended semantics of a signalfd file descriptor
after an execve()?
As far as I can work out, after an execve() the file descriptor
is still available, but reads from it always return 0, even if:
a) there were signals pending before the execve().
   However, sigpending() shows the signal as pending,
   and the signal can be accepted using sigwaitinfo().
b) we generate a signal after the execve().
Is this intended behavior (the "orphaned sighand" condition
mentioned in the draft man page you sent me?)?  Is it a bug?
Cheers,
Michael
