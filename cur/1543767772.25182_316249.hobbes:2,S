I am working on a linux (v 2.4.20) based powerpc(8260) board. During
development of an application program I planned to use real time
signals(SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX) for interprocess communication. On giving
the command 'kill -l' on the terminal window of ppc linux  it displayed
only 32 signals while giving the same command on an Intel based Linux PC
(same kernel version) showed all 64 signals. 
Anyone having idea whether these signals are present in powerpc Linux
kernal v 2.4.20 ?
