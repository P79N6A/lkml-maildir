With a conditional reschedule in generic_file_read,
generic_file_write and truncate_inode_pages the scheduling
latency falls from 130 millisecs to 4 millisecs during a kernel build.
I don't think mmap002 is a very pointful test.  "Don't
run mmap002 when you're doing multimedia".
Here's the story on mmap002:

160 milliseconds in sys_msync() -> "don't use sys_msync()...."
That 75 millisecs in open.c is the fput(filp) in sys_close().  Investigating...
syscall 120 is sys_clone.
syscall 1 is sys_exit.
All very interesting, but really the only thing which needs tweaking in
the filesystem apart from the patch below appears to be sys_close().  After that
I'll take a look at X11 and /proc performance.
On a fast uniprocessor, it is going to be very hard to do better
than 3.5 milliseconds.
BTW: I love the comment below about shared mappings :)
