i believe this is not generic enough. Eg. my box was already doing DMA to
pages which were never-ever mapped into kernel-space. We do not need to
_access_ page contents to do DMA to it, this is where the 'virtual
address' assumption breaks.
(the basic kiobuf concept and approach is of course correct and cool, it's
just these issues we need to discuss before the kiobuf interface is pushed
into drivers in a largescale way.)
