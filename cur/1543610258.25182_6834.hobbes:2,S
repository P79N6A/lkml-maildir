Erm, while disabling set and get as a nice idea, you only need to disable 
get. Disabling set will mean you 'cannot' reset the file that is causing 
the problem, because chattr won't actually be able to do what you want.
I haven't looked at the code that chattr uses either, but you may want to 
check at HOW it sets/resets values.
eg: Does it read in the value, change the bit and write it out again, or 
does it just change that bit? If it reads and get is disabled, well then 
you would want to make sure you set the 'full value' that needs to be 
there. Not a bug so much as something that just needs to be documented.
