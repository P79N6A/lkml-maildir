Hi
        while I am running mmap002 in test9-pre4 I got the computer
        frozen, it don't answer to my open windows anymore, it answers
        only to pings.  I have got the attached traces.  The machine
        is SMP with IDE disks.
        I had no additional/local patches applied.
        This traces came form kdb, but when I run without kdb, SysRq +
        P shows always one EIP that is inside default_idle.  I got
        that freeze in the first run of mmap002. (I have got the
        freeze in test8+riel patches.  At that point they happened
        only sometimes and I was not able to reproduce without local
        patches applied, that is the reason that I haven't reported
        them here before.  I reported then to Rik anyway).
        I am investigating further here, but any comment/patch is
        welcome :)))
Later, Juan.
