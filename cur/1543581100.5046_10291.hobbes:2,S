I'm having problems with the natsemi drivers on my Netgear FA-311 card.
On one host, I get lots of messages like this:
eth1: Something Wicked happened! 0700.
eth1: Something Wicked happened! 0740.
eth1: Something Wicked happened! 0740.
eth1: Something Wicked happened! 0740.
eth1: Something Wicked happened! 0740.
eth1: Something Wicked happened! 0740.
eth1: Something Wicked happened! 0540.
This is on a K6-166
On my athlon/duron, I don't get those messages, but once in a while it will 
just stop working.  If I bring the interface down, remove the module, and 
bring the interface back up again it will start to work again.
These two cards are connected by a crossover cable.  When the cards are 
working the link works just fine.
What more information do I need to obtain?  Please cc me, though I'll
be watching the list archives as well.
