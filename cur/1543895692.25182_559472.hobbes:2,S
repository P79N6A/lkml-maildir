The logic is close to:
   => License forbids X
   => developer has requirement for X in license, can't add to project
   => License forbidding X is bad
When it comes to TiVO the reason the developers "required" the "tivoization" 
was because the company itself demanded it. The reason: providers of the 
content their device works with demanded it.

Actually, it is. Every "Free Software" developer that I personally know could 
care less about the FSF's motives - until they impact them. Since they don't 
care what the FSF does, publishes, etc... they cannot be termed "Free 
Software" developers (using the definition of the term "Free Software" 
provided by the FSF). In fact, almost all of them will state either: "I work 
on Open Source software" or "I develop FOSS stuff".

Yes, the sample could be considered "biased" - jst as a sample taken among the 
GCC developers could be considered "biased" towards the other end of the 
spectrum.

It's time to quote a very ancient source: "Don't point out the speck in your 
neighbors eye when you cannot see the log in your own"
In other words - you've done the same and more.

Linus doesn't have to. Statistically the number of people that will even think 
of modifying the code running on a "tivoized" device is minute - at most 5% 
of the users of such a device. Of those people the ones with the skill to 
actually do the work is an even smaller number - figure 2.5 to 3% of them. Of 
those  with the skill, probably about 10% of them are actually *good* enough 
at it for their changes to be useful. Of that number, figure that only 25%, 
at most, will contribute the changes back.
Apply that to a sample case:
"tivoized" device total users: 1,000,000
people that think about modifying: 50,000 (5%)
people with skill: 1500 (3%)
people who are good enough for the changes to be useful: 150 (10%)
those who will contribute them back: 38 (25%)
Now a normal companies software department is anywhere from 10 to 50 people. 
Large companies can employ more - IBM employs hundreds.
What you are arguing is that people should abandon a firm set of developers 
that is proven to be large for the potential at adding, at most, 38 
developers per million users of the device. If that number was more than 1000 
per device I'd agree. The numbers don't support your argument.
