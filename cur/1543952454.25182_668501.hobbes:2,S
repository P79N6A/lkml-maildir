OK, in that case we shouldn't worry.

No, but it is very possible I missed something.
What if rcu_needs_cpu(cpu) is executed before cpu_set(cpu, nohz_cpu_mask)?
It can miss rcu_start_batch() -> rcp->cur++ and return false, but at the
same time rcu_start_batch() may see nohz_cpu_mask without this CPU.
No?
