There aren't any fixed windows for development, review, testing, and so
on.  There is only Linus' merge window for the merge process of the
patches that have been reviewed, tested, and pre-integrated.
Of course people like akpm and the maintainers of the larger subsystems
necessarily align their own work with Linus', therefore there may be
periods around merge windows during which relevant people won't
integrate larger submissions.  But that does not mean you could not post
them.
