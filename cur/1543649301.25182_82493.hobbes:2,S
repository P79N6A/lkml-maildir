From some good and bad experiences in the desktop universe - you need
people who are willing to collate bugs, sort them, tidy duplicates,
identify the most common bug report etc. Without that it doesn't work.
Watching what Luis did to the gnome bug reporting has been an education
but I don't think he can be cloned trivially and I don't think we could
run off with him 8)
Bug reporting systems need maintenance or they collapse
