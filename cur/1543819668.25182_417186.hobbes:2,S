Subject: [Patch: 000/006] pgdat allocation for new node add
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello.
These are parts of patches for new nodes addition v4.
When new node is added, new pgdat is allocated and initialized by this patch.
These includes...
  - specify node id at add_memory().
  - start kswapd for new node.
  - allocate pgdat and register its address to node_data[].
This set includes node_data[] updater for generic arch.
Ia64 has copies of node_data[] on each node.
But, this patch set doesn't include patches to update them.
I'll post them later.
This patch is for 2.6.17-rc1-mm3.
Please apply.
------------------------------------------------------------
Change log from v4 of node hot-add.
  - generic pgdat allocation is picked up.
  - update for 2.6.17-rc1-mm3.
V4 of post is here.
