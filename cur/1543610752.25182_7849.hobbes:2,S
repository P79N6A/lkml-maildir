	One potential work-around is a patch to
net/ipv4/igmp.c:ip_mc_join_group.
For example:
#ifdef DUAL_MCAST_BIND
   if(!imr->imr_ifindex) {
      imr->ifindex=2;  /* eth0 */
      err=ip_mc_join_group(sk, imr);
      if (!err) {
        imr->ifindex=3; /* eth1 */
        err=ip_mc_join_group(sk, imr);
      }
      return err;
   }
#else
   if(!imr->imr_ifindex)
     in_dev = ip_mc_find_dev(imr);
#endif
	I'm hoping that there is another way.

I have seen this problem when trying to use an NTP server to multicast
to two ethernets.  Unfortunately, NTP's output would only send to one of
the networks (eth0).
I never did find a workaround.
