Actually, now that I actually look at it, I notice that it doesn't pass in 
"--full" to git-fsck-objects, so it doesn't actually work that well in the 
presense of dangling objects that are inside pack-files.
(And if it wasn't already obvious, with my patch you still need to do 
"git-fsck-objects --full --lost-n-found" if you want to look inside those 
pack-files, but at least it's an option you can enable).
