Thanks Robert,
So what is the procedure in Linux to test for these problems?
I was thinking:
- scan for bad blocks
- maybe check the SMART results if they are available
- memory check: memtest86 & memtest86+ tests (just in case)
Anything I missed?
Does someone know a diagnostics utilities CD (a la Dell diagnostics)
that you can boot on your PC, let run for x hours and get feedback?
Cheers,
Jerome
