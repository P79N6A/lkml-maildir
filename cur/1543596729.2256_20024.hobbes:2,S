	Great.  Thanks for testing it!

	On my Sony Vaio C1VN PictureBook, the host bridge subsystem
vendor ID is Transmeta, not Sony.  The device with the Sony subsystem
vendor ID are the firewire controller, sound devices, soft modem,
cardbus bridge and video.  So, you could would not work on it (although
I did not actually try it).
>I guess this'll still pickup Sony desktops.
	Sony desktops are also called "Vaio."  I do not know whether
they have the hardware that sonypi tries to talk to.

	Yes, although that is a task that is never complete.  So, I
would recommend that we adopt a simple test that should work into the
stock kernels with the expectation that the test will probably be
refined in the future.  Perhaps we could check the Cardbus bridge.
Does "lspci -v" on your Sony Vaio indicate that its cardbus bridge
have a subsystem vendor ID of Sony?
