OK that's true, but think: how much work has Keith put into this?  How much
did he or his employer get paid?  And how many times has he been told to go
off and fix something, as a prelude to getting the thing in?  The last time
it was the first-time build speed.  He went away and came back with a *huge*
improvement, even more than what people were demanding.  You'd think that
would be enough.
Keith has to do *two* full time jobs as long as the patch isn't merged:
developing the patch itself and tracking the whole 2.5 tree as it (rapidly)
evolves.

It is of course always regrettable when one is so rash as to call a stupid
comment a stupid comment ;-)

I thought BitKeeper was supposed to be able to deal with precisely this sort
of merge problem.  In this case, splitting the thing up just seems
unnatural, and a dubious use of time.
