Sorry, but that isn't true, unless some company is just plain stupid.
Everyone has different metrics for cache granularity based on their
cache architecture, but I can assure you that 8x 1MB segments is off
by 1-2 orders of magnitude, and has been for years.
In practice, depending on the workload, there may appear to only be 8
active segments as drives today can merge cache segments or other
similar things (architectually dependant), but the worst-case (best
case?) is significantly more.
