I agree that there would not likely be any differences except in
corner-case OOM situations, and that we would probably not want
to rely on such differences in any case.

Ah!  Thank you for the clarification -- I thought you were
talking about the number of RCU callbacks to be executed in each
rcu_do_batch() invocation.  And, yes, after MAX_SOFTIRQ_RESTART,
ksoftirqd does re-enable preemption.
						Thanx, Paul
