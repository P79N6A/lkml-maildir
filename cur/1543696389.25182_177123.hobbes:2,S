Good catch.
That nanosleep restart seems to be broken, and quite frankly, looking at 
the mess in kernel/posix-timers.c I'm not all that surprised. The code is 
total and absolute crap. I have no idea how it's even supposed to work.
I suspect that it might just work right if you disable the nanosleep stuff 
by undefining FOLD_NANO_SLEEP_INTO_CLOCK_NANO_SLEEP in <linux/signal.h>. 
Because unlike the "folded" version in posix-timers.c, the original 
version at least looks sane.
