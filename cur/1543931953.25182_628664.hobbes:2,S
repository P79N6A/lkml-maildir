Policy based mandatory access control guarantees that
"Only Bob can create block device file named sda1 in /dev directory".
But it can't guarantee that /dev/sda1 will have block-8-1 attribute.
If Bob is malicious and creates /dev/sda1 with block-8-2 attribute,
other applications that depends on the attributes of /dev/sda1 goes wrong.
So, this filesystem guarantees that /dev/sda1 has block-8-1 attribute.
