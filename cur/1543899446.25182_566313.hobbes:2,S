Or not.  That depends on your willingness to cooperate, I'd say. :-)

Well, this introduces interdependencies between processes that do not exist
otherwise.  Even if that isn't wrong per se, it's something that needs
consideration in any case.
IMO, FUSE breaks one of the assumptions that the freezer is based on and
saying that the freezer is broken because of that is unfair.

Well, the system that cannot access its filesystems is not in a consistent
state, so it generally is not reasonable to suspend or hibernate it.
In fact, NFS and similar filesystems should always be unmounted before the
suspend/hibernation to avoid problems that may arise after the resume, if
they become unavailable at that time.

IMHO, it's not _that_ clear.

I don't think we need to fix the network filesystems.
If there's a mounted filesystem and we have at least one process waiting for
it to become available in the D state (ie. uninterruptible), then the system is
not in a consistent state and should not be suspended.

And yet, Nigel thinks that the freezer is necessary for the hibernation.
Strange, no?

Yes, it does.  It's quilte similar to the BKL in that.  Still, for now, there's
no infrastructure for a more fine grained approach and instead of working
on introducing one, we're losing time in this thread.

Say you're standing on a cliff and you have three choices:
(1) stay where you are (well, this is not attractive in the long run)
(2) jump down
(3) look for a path to go down slowly?
Which one will you choose?

Are they fixed _now_?
