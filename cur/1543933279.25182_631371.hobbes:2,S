I'm ok with trying the "globally" idea, but it has to be "globally but 
only if absolutely required".
And quite frankly, how do you tell whether it's absolutely required or 
not?
I have an idea: the drivers that really need it will do a "please enable 
MMCONFIG, because I will need it" thing?
Ok?
And then, since we *need* such a "pci_enable_mmconfig()" call anyway, why 
not let the driver give which device it controls too, so that we can print 
out the information (in case the machine then hangs immediately 
afterwards), and perhaps - if it is shown to help - only do the MMCONFIG 
cycles for that particular device?
Sounds like a plan?
