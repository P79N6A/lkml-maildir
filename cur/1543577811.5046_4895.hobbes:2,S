Hi,
Apoligies in advance if this is not the right place to send this
report.
When displaying a screen-wide icon in the frame buffer for the
graphics console:
Linux version 2.4.0
Console Drivers
  Video mode selection support
    Support for frame buffer devices (EXPERMENTAL)
      VESA VGA graphics console
I found the right edge of the image to be displayed on the left edge
-- perhaps 8 pixels worth?
I compiled for a pentium III, SMP on.  I've a dual processor Pentium
III with a Matrox Graphics, Inc. MGA G400 AGP video card.  I
discovered this using the lpp-0.2.0 patch at 
http://lpp.freelords.org
,
which displays a startup screen.
Fix:  turning SMP off fixed the problem.
FYI: fbcon_show_logo() in drivers/video/fbcon.c seems to have a for
loop with an odd smp_num_cpus reference.
Please contact me if you need any more information or wish to tell me
where to send this report.
Regards,
Karl <kop@meme.com>
