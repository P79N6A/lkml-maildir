Why don't you use multiple firmware loading calls with different
names?  Maybe adding a "group" name, or simply adding a '/' in the
name.  That way the userspace half will have the choice between using
directories, tar, zip or whatever.  The speedtouch driver already
requests multiple files, having them together in one file is a
userspace problem which the kernel can help but shouldn't try to solve.

That's the price how having non-gpl compatible firmware though.

Yes.  See following too.

An infrastructure to add a number of files to the kernel image (_not_
the initrd/initramfs) which can be found through internal kernel
calls, firmware loading and probably an export in /proc would be nice.
Unifying DSDT override, config.gz and early firmware could be nice.

Does it change between kernel versions?  How often?
  OG.
