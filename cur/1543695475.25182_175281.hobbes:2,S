Hmm. I hate this.
Linus, please - don't ask for such things.
Our kernel does not need twelve thousand boot parameters.
Mouse rate is of no importance during boot.
Ergo, there is no reason to have it a boot parameter.
Doing the default thing is good enough, I agree.
And if the user wants something else, userspace should take care.
