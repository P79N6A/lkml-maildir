I just finished the combination of the two:
http://www.hansenpartnership.com/voyager/files/split-combine-2.5.6.diff
http://www.hansenpartnership.com/voyager/files/split-combine-2.5.6.BK
Also added the voyager patches
http://www.hansenpartnership.com/voyager/files/voyager-split-combine-2.5.6.diff
http://www.hansenpartnership.com/voyager/files/voyager-split-combine-2.5.6.BK
I've checked that the voyager additions will combine and boot.  There seems to 
be some problem with missing pci functions which prevent a standard SMP 
compile.  I think it has to do with a missing entry in the Makefile in 
drivers/pci for hotplug.c.  I think Patrick probably needs to look at this.
