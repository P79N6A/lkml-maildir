Yes, that is the case.

But they know why they made the change, so it's usually pretty obvious.
If not, they merely ask for help from the original author / maintainer
of the code, but that doesn't happen very often.

Sure, go through the kernel building all of the different arches and all
of the modules and report what breaks due to api changes.  The -mm tree
is the best place to test this stuff out, as that is where the changes
usually occur first.
good luck,
