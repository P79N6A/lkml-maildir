Note that even that is not needed - nfsservctl() can be easily removed;
essentially it's a userland code.  mkdir /dev/nfsctl, have nfsd mounted
on it and nfsservctl() is
	open /dev/nfsctl/blah
	write request
	possibly read reply
	close
Kernel code does exactly that, the only difference is that it creates
a temporary vfsmount not attached anywhere.  End of story.  Modular
case is handled automatically - if nfsd is not loaded, mounting (either
explicit or do_kern_mount() called in kernel version) will happily
load the module - as with any other filesystem type.
