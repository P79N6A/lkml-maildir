Don't people read Intel docs any more?
- The HT feature flag means "might have HT, check further to make sure".
- "check further" involves checking #siblings >= 2 via CPUID.
  Old P4s typically announce HT but have #siblings < 2.
- Intel made HT enabling a hardware thing via the chipset (a pin
  sampled at reset). BIOS can disable HT but only HW can enable it.
  This is why you can't put a HT-capable P4 in a non-HT-chipset
  machine and expect it to work -- although PowerLeap seemed to
  have an adapter to "fix" that.
