Hi,
On this list new version of XFS for Linux has just been announced.
Reiserfs has been included into official kernel tree. My question is
about benchmarks beetween XFS and rfs. XFS is said to a very flexible
and fast journaling filesystem (well, at least by SGI ;-) and rfs seems
to be cool too. It would be important to compare these filesystems.
Can you know benchmarks about this topic (ext2 would be usefull to be
included as well :)
