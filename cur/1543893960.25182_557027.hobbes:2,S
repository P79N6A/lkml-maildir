If I take the software I received, build it and install it on the same
hardware, it won't run.  Something is missing in the source code I
received, I guess..
If I make changes to the source code, build it, and install it on that
same computer, it won't run.  How is that being able to modify *that*
copy of the program?
If TiVo makes the same changes, builds tehm, and installs it on my
computer, it will run just fine.  How are they passing on the right
they had to me?
> You also received hardware; they don't support modification of that.
They don't have to support them.  They don't have to help me if it
breaks.  But if they can do it and I can't, they're failing to comply
with the spirit of the GPL.

They can't distribute the program while imposing restrictions on
modification not present in the software license itself.

I tend to agree, in this particular case, but IANAL.  I don't rule out
derivative works in future attempts to find loopholes in the GPL.

Then they wouldn't have the ability to change it any more, so there
wouldn't be such a right to pass on to the users.
