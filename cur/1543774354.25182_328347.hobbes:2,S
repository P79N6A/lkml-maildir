Subject: Re: [GIT PATCH] Remove devfs from 2.6.12-git

I've taken the time that I would have spent responding to this email
thread, and to other people who for some reason don't like to respond to
mailing lists but want to pester me privatly with "don't delete devfs"
type emails, and written ndevfs, a replacement in less than 300 lines
(including all needed hooks in the kernel).
If this does not meet your needs to keep devfs for your embedded
systems, please respond to the ndevfs post with the patch on lkml.
