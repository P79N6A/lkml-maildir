Given that the sparc64 work is newer, why would we want to try to merge it
with the older iBCS stuff? The theoretical answer was that someone was
supposed to port the sparc64 work in the kernel to sparc32, and it's on my
list, but right now sparcbook stuff is at higher priority, and I'd be
happy for someone else to backport the sparc64 work to sparc32, but it
seems I'm the only one who cares who actually intends to work on the code.
