I'm no kernel expert but I think that doing what you suggest would take
an enormous amount of time and resources to do. Also, the scheduler must
be a real-time piece of software, and needs to take decisions as fast
and as accurately as possible. I think that implementing an IA-like
engine would take an great deal of resources. By the time the IA-like
scheduler has taken its decision, the whole world could have changed
since.
