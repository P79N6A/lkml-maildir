Hehe.  You just reinvented my old /dev/ps driver.  :)

This is what Linus has to say on the subject:
    I do dislike /dev/ps mightily. If the problem is that /proc
    is too large, then the right solution is to just clean up
    /proc.  Which is getting done.  And yes, /proc will be larger
    than /dev/ps, but I still find that preferable to having two
    incompatible ways to do the same thing.
