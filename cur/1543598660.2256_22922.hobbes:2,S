Which may be the root of the problem. Linux seems to consider that
select indicates "would not block", whereas Solaris et. al. use
"ready to read". (The difference seems to exist in man pages too)
Clearly an unconnected socket "would not block" but is not
"ready to read".

No. If there is a correct behaviour defined in a standard we should
do that. Otherwise we should do what other systems do _unless_ there
is a clear benefit to doing something else. In this case doing
something else appears to create porting problems and confusion over
what select(2) means without any clear benefit.
So, we're back to the beginning: justify with reference or reason :-).
