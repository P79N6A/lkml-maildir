What you describe, Serge, sounds like semantics carried over from cpusets.

Yup - don't want to run a task in a cpuset that lacks cpu, or lacks
memory.  Hard to run without those.

Yup - early in the life of cpusets, a created cpuset inherited the cpus
and mems of its parent.  But that broke the exclusive property big
time.  You will recall that a cpu_exclusive or mem_exclusive cpuset
cannot overlap the cpus or memory, respectively, of any of its sibling
cpusets.
So we changed it to creating new cpusets empty of cpus or memory.
