And looking at Greg's patchset, it has cleanup_device_parent(), which
does just that. But it is only called in device_del(), not when
device_move() has errors.
(get_device_parent() also always returns a pointer to a kobject or
NULL, so we can get rid of those IS_ERR() checks in setup_parent() and
device_move() as well.)
