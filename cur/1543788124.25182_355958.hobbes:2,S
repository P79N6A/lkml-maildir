No, what got hard-coded were the concepts of inodes as the actual description
of filesystem objects, directories as lists of name-inode pairs, and the whole
user/group/other permission thing.  "unlink depends on the directory
permissions not the object unlinked" has been the semantic that people depended
on ever since some code at Bell Labs started supporting tree-structured
directories and multiple hardlinks.  POSIX merely codified existing behavior in
this case.
