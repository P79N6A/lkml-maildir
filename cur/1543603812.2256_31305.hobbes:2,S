Hi,

LDM is now part of the standard kernel, so you do not need to download 
anything from SF. (Unless you want/need the userspace utilities of course.)
>a) Is it possible to mount and read/extract the data on a 5-disk w2k 
>Dynamic Disks? In case, what commands do I use [commands, options, etc]?
Of course. Just configure your kernel with LDM partition support, 
recompile, install and boot into new kernel and the device (say it is 
/dev/hdc), will be as follows:
/dev/hdc1 = LDM database, you don't need to care about this
/dev/hdc5 = first data partition
/dev/hdc6 = second data partition
etc...
Note the order of partitions is not necessarily the same as in Windows 
because we take them in the order they appear in the database without any 
sorting. We left it for the future to decide on some kind of sorting as we 
haven't made up our minds what criteria to use for the sort yet.
Then to mount a partition (note you need to have NTFS driver configured in 
the kernel) you do:
mkdir /mnt/mynta
mount -t ntfs -o ro /dev/hdc5 /mnt/mynta
>b) Is there any difference between NTFS 3.0 and NTFS 3.1 in regards to 
>handling the file systems and/or commands?
No. The NTFS driver can read both fine. Writing is disallowed at the moment.
Best regards,
         Anton
