I would probably disagree here.
I think it makes much more sense for a filesystem to know about
multiple devices than for MD or DM to combine a bunch of devices into
the illusion of one big device, only to have the filesystem chop that
big device into little files....
(Note that I wouldn't expect a filesystem to include raid5 style
behaviour, and probably wouldn't expect raid1 like behaviour, but
having the filesystem do striping and inter-device migration itself
seems eminently sensible.)
However I don't see much value if the suggestion of a new layer that
provide lots of services of filesystems.  I strongly suspect that no
filesystem would want to use them.  Look at "jdb".  It is designed to
provide a journalling layer for any filesystem, but how many
filesystems use it?  Just one - ext3 - the one it was designed for.
