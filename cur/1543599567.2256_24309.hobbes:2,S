At least as of mid-2.2 series this was certainly my experience. It was
very frustrating that the thread/process that dumped core was not the one
that dereferenced a bad pointer/failed an assert but the process group

I am inclined to believe that that is the case. Unfortunately, I have no
advice to give - but I am writing because I think that it would be neat if
you have the time and the inclination for you to document your findings as
you progress and put them on the web.
