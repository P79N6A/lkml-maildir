Obviously, it is. But please don't feel responsible for it. This just
happened to be the trigger, but that would have happened anyway.

I know.

Except that this isn't how open-source development works. You're not my
boss, you don't get to tell me how I should work. I work the way I
like, and if it doesn't fit with the rest of the community, I better
move on.

Perfectionist - you said it. This is what I am, and this is unlikely to
change in a near future (if ever). But being a subsystem maintainer
requires that you trust contributors to some degree, and you just can't
trust contributors when you're a perfectionist. This means that the
maintainer should be less of a perfectionist than the contributors,
otherwise he/she ends up doing everything by him/herself.

I didn't say I would leave entirely. I plan to stay around and keep
helping with the lm-sensors project and hwmon drivers. I just don't
want to be the hwmon subsystem maintainer anymore, as I don't fit in
the role and this makes me (and others) unhappy.
