Hi all,
my normally (on 256 MB, dual Xeon, ASUS board, .....) working driver
module fails on a new box with 1 MB RAM, 2 PIII, ASUS board
For each card I ioremap() 2 * 16 MB of PCI memory space.
It succeeds for the 1st card but for the 2nd card I get NULL
as result. This means I cannot use the 2nd card...
Is the reason for this that the RAM is bigger? 
What could I do about it? 
- Build a 64 GB kernel? 
- Use an other function?
- pull out sone DIMM?
- nothing?
Thanks,  Bernd
