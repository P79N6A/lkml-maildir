I tried with i82365 support disabled and my card's module successfully
loaded and all was in order. When I tried ejecting the card at first,
it seemed like it would fail as I got a message in my syslog saying
"unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count =
3", but after a few patient moments, the module was finally unloaded.
Thanks for your help!
