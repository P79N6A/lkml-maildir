new and delete used to be just constructor/destructor-calling wrappers,
before exception handling went into the language.  Now new is supposed
to throw a bad_alloc exception instead of returning NULL.  If you have
an operator new like this:
   void *operator new(size_t) { return NULL; }
then g++ will complain about it even with '-fno-exceptions'.  You can use
new and delete in code without exception handling, I'm just explaining
why people would expect it to be an issue.
Periodically someone posts a minimal C++ runtime to LKML.  A much larger
problem than the runtime is the fact that C++ is not the language of
choice of other kernel developers, making them reluctant to deal with
(and hence, to incorporate) your driver.
