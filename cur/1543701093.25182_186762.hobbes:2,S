For reference, I just took 2.4.24-pre2, applied the device-mapper
patches to it, and re-ran the tests.
Base performance on /dev/sda is a bit slower (70 MB/sec vs 80 MB/sec
raw writespeed), but speeds on /dev/sda1 and /dev/vg0/test are
exactly the same.
So it doesn't look like a 3ware driver or LVM issue as those are
basically the same between the 2.4 and 2.6 systems.
Mike.
