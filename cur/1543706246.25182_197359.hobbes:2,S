Really? Then you don't have anybody trying to log-in
from the network using telnet, then do you?
The BSD virtual terminals go in pairs, /dev/ptyp* /dev/ttyp*

Here, rjohnson is logged in using telnet. The code is so common
that there is even some C runtime library support in later
C libraries, it's called forkpty(). `man forkpty`. It does a lot
of the dirty-work of using BSD virtual terminals.
Cheers,
