Hi,
thanks for the emails. I made some further tests under Linux. They
indicate a memory error (hardware).
(It is difficult to swap the memory modules between the banks because I
have a single module, I wrote 
it!). I increased the wait states (CAS, RAS) and underclocked my CPU
(400/100 --> 200/66) but the 
errors still occurs.
But the memory test program (ctramtest from Andreas Stiller) for DOS
works and do not show any error.
So I wrote my own test program using a random numbers as test pattern.
This program detect errors in Bit 2
on certain addresses. If I test with constant patterns no errors occur!
You can download the program from my homepage

(

). Its written in MASM
(the only good 
Microsoft program I know and the best ASM I know)
Thanks, SZ
