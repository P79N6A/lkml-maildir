You have to parse filesystem paths if you want to understand them.  You
have to either agree on a one-size-fits-all naming scheme, or use multiple
schemes and store duplicate information.  You have to develop an intimate
relationship between the kernel and a daemon if you want to keep current
in the face of hot-plugging, and a number of people think *that* is evil.
(I'm undecided on this last point.)

Can't help you there since I never said that.  I don't consider myself a
devfs detractor either; at most I've asked people to consider whether a
filesystem hierarchy is really the most appropriate representation for the
various information that we all want.

Nod.  Is anyone taking notes on the various orthogonal issues being
trumpeted?
