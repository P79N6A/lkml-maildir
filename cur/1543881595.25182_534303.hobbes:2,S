We have been investigating Linux support for the following chips:
Zilog		Z16C30 (also known as the "USC" or just 16C30)
Zilog		Z16C32 (also known as the "IUSC" or just 16C32)
http://www.zilog.com/products/family.asp?fam=200
Infineon	"SEROCCO" family
		SAB/SAF-20532 ("Serial Optimized Communications Controller")
		SAB/SAF-20542 ("Serial Optimized Communications Controller with DMA")

I grepped 6.20 and 4.34 extensively, and found
drivers/char/synclink*.c which appear to use the 16C32. Google turned
up 
http://www.evolware.org/chri/serocco/index.html
 for the Infineon
chips, but it's an out-of-tree driver.
Is anyone aware of any other Linux drivers for those chips?
