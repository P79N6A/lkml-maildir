I didn't notice the increase in system time.
Could you generate a kernel profile?  Add `profile=1' to the kernel boot
command line and run:
sudo readprofile -r
sudo readprofile -M10
time make -j4
readprofile -n -v -m /boot/System.map | sort -n +2 | tail -40 | tee ~/profile.txt >&2
on both 2.4 and 2.6?  Make sure the System.map is appropriate to the
currently-running kernel.
