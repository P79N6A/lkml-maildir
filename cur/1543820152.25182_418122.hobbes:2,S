It's occurred to me that the unusual thing about struct address_space
is that it does _not_ have a slab cache of its own: it's for years been
part of the struct inode itself; and I guess that exposes it to an
alignment issue which slab objects themselves avoid.  But still a
good idea to add the explicit alignment as doc.
