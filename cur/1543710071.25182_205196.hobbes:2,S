That's expected, unless you have no cache ;) Then you also
have the TLB misses..

No. It depends mostly on cache effects and bus usage, though
you can probably get good approximation for both the cases
where everything is in the cache on both sides of the copy,
and when you are in the worst case scenario of cold cache
or larger copy than the cache.
