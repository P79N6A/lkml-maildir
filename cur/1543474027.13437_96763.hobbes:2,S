There's other view possible: why bother having core-dumper in kernel,
when you can have userland process doing it?
Imagine kernel execing /sbin/coredump-him <PID> <dumpable> when
someone needs to dump core. It is both more flexible than current
approach, and probably would save some kernel space (confirmed, saves
4230 bytes of kernel size). Disadvantages are:
* it is slower
...which does not matter: core dumps are slow, anyway, and they
happen rarely
* it will not work without /proc mounted
...not too important because you usualy do not have / readwrite when
/proc is not mounted, so you would not be able to dump core, anyway.
[can not think of more]
I do not know how hard writing of userland coredumper is, mj says it
is possible and not that hard. I do not think this is important... I
may play with it on one cloudy day.
