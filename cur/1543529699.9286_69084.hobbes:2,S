Do you volunteer ?

This is true.

Quite untrue. If app is important enough or if there are numerous important
apps then changes are done to support them. Even if it's against POSIX and
even if it's "not right in ideal world". Linus's letter just few days ago:

Ahhah!
This is another change in 2.3.x behaviour: it is a POSIX requirement that
I don't particularly like, but there you have it. Any access past the last
page of a file should give a SIGBUS. Previous Linux behaviour was to just
map in a zero page.

I will leave the SIGBUS behaviour, andif this is the only program that
breaks due to new POSIX conformance, I will consider us very lucky indeed.
Finges crossed. If some other major package breaks we will probably have
to forget that particular conformance detail..

Note last paragraph... Yes, a spade will be called a spade in rude comment
inside kernel but kernel WILL be changed to support spade if this spade
(or spades) is important enough. This was done by Linus zillion times before...

Once again: go and fix them. When you'll return with patches for majority of
them THEN we can sonsider removing OOM hack from kernel. It's quite easy to
say that all daemons should be fixed. It's often not easy to fix them. Yes,
in ideal world all deamons will tolerate ENOMEM. We live in real world, not in
ideal world.
