Subject: RLIM_INFINITY duplicate definition in resource.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The file include/asm-i386/resource.h in 2.3.42 defines RLIM_INFINITY
It gives it a value inconsistent with RLIM_INFINITY in
/usr/include/bits/resource.h.(as installed by glibc 2.1.2 on RedHat 6.1).
I don't know when this definition was added, but it was after 2.3.8.
This conflict needs to be fixed.  It causes warnings for any
program that does #include <sys/resource.h>.  It causes gcc to fail
to compile (because configure interpretes the warning messages such
that sys/resource.h doesn't exist).
My quick work-around was to move the #define RLIM_INFINITY inside
the #ifdef __KERNEL__.  But considering that that the two
definitions of RLIM_INFINITY yield different values, perhaps
RLIM_INFINITY is the wrong name anyway.
(I'm not on the linux-kernel mailing list, so please cc me.
I hope this is not a duplicate;  I didn't see any mention
of this problem when I ran a search.)
