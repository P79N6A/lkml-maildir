Debian GNU/Linux is a good example of a distribution shipping source
and configured kernel header packages seperately. It seems fair enough
to require a configured source tree installed, however, and I don't
have a strong opinion on this particular question.

Not necessarily.

External projects may not want to use the build flags unchanged, they
may have good reasons for using their own. It seems sensible to make
the kernel build system available to those who wish to use it, but it
should be optional rather than mandatory. In this specific case, there
is no technical reason to require the use of kbuild.
