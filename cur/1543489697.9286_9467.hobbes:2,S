But 0xff0000 is 16M - 64K.
I don't know anything about the TNT, but it's possible that it uses a
framebuffer of slightly less than 16MB, and a 64KB area for MMIO (or
maybe some real memory used for non-framebuffer purposes).

The part you want a write-combining region for is the frame-buffer. If
it's not clear from the X server output, there is another way. With X
running, find the pid of the X server and cat /proc/<pid>/maps. One of
the entries will be the mmap of the framebuffer, and you can find its
physical address and exact size.

Which makes it look likely that you really do have a 0xff0000 byte
framebuffer. If the other 64KB is an MMIO area, write-combining it
could lead to problems.
You can create a write-combining range over a 0xff0000 byte
framebuffer, but it's a little bit more complicated than usual.
The MTRRs only support regions with a power-of-two size. You could
break a region of size 0xff0000 into 8 such regions, but current Intel
processor only have 8 MTRR ranges, and you need one or more to cover
main memory.
There is another way: You can add a write-combining region, then cover
part of it with an uncached region, and within that part the uncached
region will take precedence. The MTRR driver code knows that cases of
overlapping regions like this are legal.
So something like
# echo "base=0xe6000000 size=0x1000000 type=write-combining" >! /proc/mtrr
# echo "base=0xe6ff0000 size=0x10000 type=uncachable" >! /proc/mtrr
it should work.
[The rest is mostly a note to Richard, since I'm on the subject.]
It would be nice if something did this automatically. Working out the
minimum number of regions needed to cover a range of any size is a
tractable problem, but would require quite a bit of code. However, two
region cases are pretty easy. Any range that has
- Any contiguous block of set bits in the size (can use a
"subtractive" region as above), or
- Two bits set anywhere in the size (can create two neighbouring
regions).
can be write-combined using two regions. It doesn't take much code to
detect and deal with these cases.
My MTRR support in XFree86 (to appear in 4.0) currently only deals
with power-of-two framebuffer ranges (actually it just passes the
framebuffer range straight to the MTRR driver), but I'm tempted to add
two region support.
The MTRR driver also provides MTRR access to the rest of the kernel;
from what Scott write, it looks like fbcon could use two region
support? There is a neat way to do it without changing the MTRR API:
The MTRR driver could reveal virtual MTRR ranges to user space and the
rest of the kernel, then when changes are made it "renders" the
virtual ranges into the true MTRR registers (or whatever non-Intel
processors have). This would also allow support of the fixed MTRR
ranges is a consistent way. The question is whether it could be done
without unduly increasing the size of the MTRR driver.
