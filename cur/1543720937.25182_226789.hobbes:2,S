Heh...how did I know that was coming...
I realize I can't reasonably ask here about problems if things blow up.  I was 
actually more interested in exactly what the conflicts were between a binary 
chunk compiled with gcc2 linked with source compiled with gcc3 and loaded into a 
kernel compiled with gcc3.
I had hoped some of the modutils people might respond, since they obviously know 
of some issues.
