I like this: introduce a tasks.h to separate the task_struct and any
helper macros that depend on it.
We can keep sched.h though - but just for scheduler stuff from sched.c. 
We need a place to put the prototypes, inlines, and defines from sched.c
and sched.h is the cleanest place.
It is the other stuff (task_struct most importantly, as you point out)
that needs to go.

Indeed, good job.
