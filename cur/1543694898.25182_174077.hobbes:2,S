Sorry for the confusion. Karl's error messages looked just like ones that were 
reported on the evms-devel list, which were supposedly fixed by the above 
patch.

This will probably work, as long as raid0 can split a one-page request that 
spans a chunk boundary. I'll be interested to see if this solves Karl's 
problem.
Joe Thornber was telling me about an idea he had to solve the 
Device-Mapper-on-top-of-MD problem using the dm-io code in his latest 
Device-Mapper patchset 
(
http://people.sistina.com/~thornber/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test6/2.6.0-t6-mm1-dm2.tar.bz2
). 
I believe he's away for this week, but I'll ask him about it again the next 
time I talk to him.
