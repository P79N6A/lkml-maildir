Just to follow up, I compiled 2.4.16 with the
low latency patch from Andrew Morton, as
well as the 2.4.16-disk-i/o-responsiveness
patch from Andrew, and tux-full-2.4.16-A3.
I hammered tux all night with an apachebench
script, and it never hiccupped. So, while tux
and preempt don't play well together, tux and
low-latency seem to get along just fine.
