Agreed... the more type checking you can provide, the better.
Note that if it is possible to avoid the union in a manner that follows
the VFS inode cleanup, feel free to that too...  Basically each private
info struct looks like
	struct foo_inode {
		/* ... driver-private stuff here ... */
		struct inode vfs_inode;	/* last member of struct */
	};
Making it the last member of the structure ensures that people are not
tempted to do gross typecasting based on assumptions that the
"superclass" type is always located at the beginning of the subclass
substructure.  (I don't know how well that applies to this case, just a
suggestion...)
