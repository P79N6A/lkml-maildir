The serial driver can not and does not know in advance how many characters
the other is going to send.  As far as the serial driver is concerned, it's
just a meaningless stream of characters.
To give an example, if your device sends the following character stream:
  first                                               last
    v                                                   v
    .....................................................
your line discipline may receive this as four separate blocks:
    ................                                       block 1
                    ................                       block 2
                                    .................      block 3
                                                     ....  block 4
It may not receive it like the above - it may be several blocks of 8
characters or whatever, depending on the UARTs FIFO, interrupt load,
etc.
There is just no way for the serial driver itself to batch them back
up.
