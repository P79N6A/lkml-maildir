Hi, this is unify-pfn_to_page patch take3. thank you for comments on
previous version.
This patch consolidates definitions of pfn_to_page/page_to_pfn which are
defined by each arch to generic one. Most of archs can use it.
This patch is against 2.6.16-rc3 and totally rewritten.
Changelog v2 -> v3
  - linux/memory_model.h is moved to asm-generic/memory_model.h
  - If an arch can use generic funcs, it includes asm-generic/memory_model.h.
    If not, it doesn't include them. (m68k, m68knommu, ia64 + virtual_mem_map)
  - remvoed CONFIG_ARCH_PFN_TO_PAGE
  - CONFIG_DONT_INLINE_PFN_TO_PAGE was renamed to CONFIG_OUT_OF_LINE_PFN_TO_PAGE
    This is used by x86_64+DISCONTIGMEM and sparc64.
Changelog: v1->v2
  - linux/memory_model.h is added. this defines pfn<->page translation.
  - new config options (set by arch) CONFIG_DONT_INLINE_PFN_TO_PAGE
    and CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_PFN_TO_PAGE are added.
  - SPARSEMEM's page_to_pfn is moved to linux/memory_model.h
-- Kame.
