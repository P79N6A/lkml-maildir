Huh?  I can tell from context that this is all my fault (to which
I agree; it is), but what does "BPB" stand for?

Because we have immense confusion about which combinations of
config options (NUMA, DISCONTIG, VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP, SMP) are
supported.  Kconfig allows almost any combination of them, but on
any given week only some combinations work.  The patch that broke
things for you came in to fix a problem for Peter.
I'll take a look at this.  Can you post the .config that you
are using.
