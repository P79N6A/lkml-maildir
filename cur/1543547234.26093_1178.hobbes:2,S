No, not necessarily. What matters is the open count of the drive. Currently
it will not unlock a tray, that is opened by other programs as well.

I don't think that allowing root to unlock a busy tray is that big a
deal, we have to assume he/she knows what they are doing anyway. But
for now, you can try this patch.
