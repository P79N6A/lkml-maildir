I agree, except that the earlier 2.4.0 kernels they are using
are also buggy to one degree or another (for instance, the Tulip
driver didn't start working for my cards untill about 2.4.8, and
by then the VM seems to have gone berserk...)  Hell, many of the
official kernels won't even compile with certain options turned
on, which is really frightening, and makes it hard to run regression
tests...
It's almost like we need to fork off a 2.5 kernel just to let the
pressure for massive change off, and let less panic'ed changes go
into the 2.4 series...
The fact that there's a 20MB patch to get from Linus to AC is also
disconcerting!!
