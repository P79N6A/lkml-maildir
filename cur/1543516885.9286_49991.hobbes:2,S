Hello folk,
I'm newbie in this maillist and hope it's right place for my question.
I have next trouble/situation:
I have some programs and telnetd working in an chrooted partition,
I have also kernel 2.2.9-ac6 with UNIX98 ptys compiled in
So when anybody log into the system throuth ssh (in basic root partition)
and one log in by telnet (in chroot partition), in both (basic root and
chroot) partitions in /dev/pts filesystem appear both!!! pty devices with
                                                 ^^^^^^^
strange modes and ownership:
in basic root:
>ls -l /dev/pts/
total 0
crw--w----   1 valya    tty      136,   0 Nov 24 13:25 0
crw--w--w-   1 root     root     136,   1 Nov 24 13:25 1
in chroot:
>chroot /web/ !!
chroot /web/ ls -l /dev/pts/
total 0
crw--w--w-   1 root     root     136,   0 Nov 24 12:16 0
crw--w----   1 valya    tty      136,   1 Nov 24 13:25 1
--------------------------------------------------------------
 - pty 0 was logged in basic root and pty 1 in chrooted partition.
so any user from basic root system can write to chrooted pty and
any user from chroot can write to basic root ptys.
It seems to me slightly wrong ;)
And one problem too:
After some days work well my server in chrooted partition loose possibility
to log users in by telnet. I think it is because of some problems with ptys but
I wouldn't say it with certainty... ;)
