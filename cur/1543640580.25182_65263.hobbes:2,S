These errors (and more) are addressed in a patch which should be making its
way upstream.  Please feel free to grab it out of the
sparclinux@vger.kernel.org mailing list archives if you really want to use
pre4.  Also, sparclinux@vger.kernel.org is the sparc32 mailing list, so
please post any problems/patches there.
