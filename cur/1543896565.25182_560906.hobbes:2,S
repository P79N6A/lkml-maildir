The problems are the parts of the kernel without maintainer or with a 
maintainer who is for whatever reason not able to look after bug 
reports.
And you often need someone with a good knowledge of a specific area of 
the kernel for getting a bug fixed.
Let me make an example:
During 2.6.16-rc, I reported a bug (not a regression) in CIFS where I 
had reproducible during big writes to a Samba server after some 100 MBs 
(not a fixed amount of data, but 100% reproducible when transferring 1 GB)
a complete freeze of my computer (no SysRq possible). And there is
nothing more I (or any other submitter) could have given as information -
in fact it even took me several days to isolate CIFS as the source of 
these freezes.
Steve French and Dave Kleikamp told me to try some mount option.
With this option, I got an Oops instead of a freeze.
After they fixed the Oops, it turned out the patch also fixed the 
freeze. The patch went into 2.6.16, and it was therefore fixed
in 2.6.16.
That's one important value of maintainers.
In many other parts of the kernel, my bug report wouldn't have had any 
effect.
We need more maintaners who look after bugs - but where to find them, 
they don't seem to grow on trees?
