Do we only need to determine there was an error in the IO hierarchy
or do we also need to know which device/driver caused the error?
If the latter I agree with linus. If the former, then the error recovery
can support asyncronous errors (like the bad DMA address case) and tell
all affected (thanks willy) drivers.
