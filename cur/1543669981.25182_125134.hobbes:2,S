Patch looks right...

If you are right that the K6-2 and K6-3D support 3DNow!, then yes.  At
least its "correct" but it may not be optimal: I seem to recall 3DNow
memory copies were not worthwhile on anything before an Athlon.  Double
check that, though.

Yes.  Even if the above is true, splitting the K6 out like this is
useful for the extra -march here.  It certainly does not hurt (picking
the original K6 will give proper support for the whole family, in
needed).
