because dump_imap() is just a BFS' internal helper (for debugging purposes 
only btw) to dump the inode map via printk. Why should it be moved into 
the header, i.e. where one expects to see things potentially visible by 
the rest of the kernel?

maybe this script should be simplified to not complain at things like 
that, which are best left to the author of the code to decide which 
declaration should be where?
Kind regards
