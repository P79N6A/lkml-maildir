No. Just plain 2.2.19 + reiserfs 3.5.32. Should i use any patches ? 
I just checked ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mason/reiserfs/patches and 
there are only 2.2.19pre patches. 
Does it help to mount the filesystems noatime ?
Chris, do you have any idea where the problem may be located ? 
Cheers,
-Michael
