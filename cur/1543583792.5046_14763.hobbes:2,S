They probably wasted too much memory ...
Having _2_ quicklists per CPU (on SMP) is probably the way
to go: one with zeroed pages and one with non-zeroed pages.
This should avoid cache contention in __alloc_pages() and
also avoid unneeded zeroing of pages (when we put away a
zeroed page, eg. an freed pagetable page).
On UP we probably want a (smaller) freelist with zeroed
pages only, since that means we can keep more pages on the
inactive_clean list.

Rik
