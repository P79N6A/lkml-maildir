You might think so at first.  But suppose another device of the same 
type got plugged in instead -- with different data stored on it.  That 
would be just as bad.

This has nothing to do with USB particularly; it applies to all forms
of hot-pluggable or removable storage.  Even floppy disks.

Wait a minute.  You're saying that USB Persist worked under 2.6.21
because it wasn't available?  That makes no sense.  Besides, if you
don't like USB Persist under 2.6.23, you can always eliminate it by
turning off CONFIG_USB_PERSIST.

It may be the case that _your_ particular computer wasn't aware of
unplug or replug events during suspend, but if so then it was a bug and
it isn't true in general.  The fact that your computer is now aware of
these things proves this.
In short, you aren't reporting a bug -- you're asking for a new feature 
to be added.
From the point of view of the kernel, being suspended is in some
respects like remaining awake.  Hotplug events are detected in either
case.  Would you also want the ability to unplug and replug your root
fs while the computer was running?  Would it make sense to add such an
ability?
There was a time during the 2.4 kernel series when usb-storage would 
try to keep track of devices after they had been unplugged and 
recognize them when they were re-attached.  Linus himself said it was 
a bad idea and consequently it was removed.  Now you're saying you want 
it back.  I think you'll have to convince Linus before anyone else will 
pay attention.  It's worth a try -- he might think your airport 
scenario is common enough to be worth supporting.
