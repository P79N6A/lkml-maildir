Ok, I was just trying to rule out the RAID.
I know for a fact that fsck does not defrag the filesystem.  However, if you
do run fsck, it will tell you how much is fragmented.
A few percent shouldn't matter.  But see what the fragmentation is when you
have only one gig available, compared to when you have five.

Oh, silly me.  I'm mixing up mails here...  Sure, with SCSI you'll be fine.

Yep.
If everything is slowed down by disk seeks due to high fragmentation, you
should actually be able to hear your disks seek like mad when the load is high.
Throughput doesn't matter much in that case - have you noticed the sound of
disk-heads (sonic booms, heads catching on fire, etc.)  ?
