Yep.
Thanks to everyone's input I was able to test and adapt my mm work.
It is hopefully at a stage where it can have wider testing now. It
is stable on my SMP system under very heavy swapping, but the usual
caution applies.
Test is 4 x cat 8GB > /dev/null (aggregate 100-200MB/s!) while in X,
with xterms and mozilla open browsing and grepping kernel tree, etc.
Plain 2.6.7-rc1-mm1 swapped 200MB then completely froze up the system
within 9 seconds of starting the read load. Things remained fairly
responsive with my patch applied. A bit of swap out, but very little
swap in, which is good. The entire 32GB went through the pagecache no
problem.
A couple of concurrent mkisofs's writing 4 GB isos don't seem to be
any problem either with the patched kernel. Haven't tried plain -mm
yet.

It is a cocktail of cleanups, simplification, and enhancements. The
main ones that applie here is my split active lists patch (search
archives for details), and explicit use-once logic.
Known issue: page reclaim can get a little bit lumpy (ie lots of
memory freed up at once), but that is just a matter of teaching
things not to bite off massive chunks at a time when it starts
hitting memory pressure.
