Crapola. I've just realised why this is no longer relevant.
I've moved what this was protecting into the per chipset modules.
Right now its possible to load modules, start x (which loads DRM),
then rmmod via_agp from under its feet. result - boom when something
tries to use 3d.
Sure it's unlikely someone would be crazy enough to try and do this,
and they deserve what they get, but it's not exactly clean, or nice.
So where is the documentation describing module locking de jour ?

I'll need 'something' in the chipset drivers. The first thing that
jumps to mind is to give the chipset drivers an 'acquire' op
which does the locking much like the old agp_backend_acquire() does.

Why exactly isn't it safe any more?  If there's documentation on this,
I'd love to read it. If there isn't, there really should be.
