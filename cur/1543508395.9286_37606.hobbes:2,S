Thats pure BS! Actually a zip disk formatted as a "DOS" disk in Mac OS
makes puts the new partition on entry 1. When it comes to Mac OS
partitioned
disks, its not just the numbering that differs, but the whole partition
scheme. Those are the only ones that are incompatible between
windoze/mac os.
When it comes to Linux, it have no problems reading mac partitioned
disks,
oh course (as long as you compiled support for it in the kernel).
