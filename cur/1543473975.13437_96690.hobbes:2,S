It appears I jumped too quickly.  There were some library issues with
that particular package.  In addition there may have also been an issue
with glibc 2.1, the basis for "rawhide" redhat.  I've since retreated,
and went a different direction which allowed me to update properly.
Source is your friend, as I'm finding out more often these days.
Thanks to everyone for the comments.
