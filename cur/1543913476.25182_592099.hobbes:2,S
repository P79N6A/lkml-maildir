That turned out to break on some VIA CPUs. Should be removed.

It would be best to copy __inline_memcpy from x86-64 to i386
and use that here. That avoids the dependency on a patched
memcpy and is slightly safer.

In general BUG_ON only should be enough because these values can
be recovered from the registers.

The common code should be in a common function. In fact they're so 
similar that the caller could just pass a buffer for the text_set
case, couldn't it?

Is there a real reason this has to be an macro? It could 
be just a normal function. In fact a shared on in alternative.c.
That would also avoid adding more include dependencies.

typecheck is probably overkill

Should disable interrupts too just to be safer?
