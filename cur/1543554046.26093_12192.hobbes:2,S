If we would not allow binary only modules I would not have such a big
problem with that...
I understand that the one size fits all approach has some limitations
if you want to run on PDAs up to big iron. But a framework to overload
core kernel functions with modules smells a lot of binary only, closed
source, vendor specific Linux on high end machines. 
And then I don't see the value of Linux anymore.
