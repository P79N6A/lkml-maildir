I think everyone agrees that you should start with doing it for a 
particular FS, and then after you have done it for one, you will know 
enough about what needs to be done that you can make your case that it 
should be done in VFS.  Frankly, I think that you should either share 
caches between nodes (NUMA), or (somehow, and there are so many ways...) 
divide the workload between the machines such that they don't access the 
same data except in response to failure.
