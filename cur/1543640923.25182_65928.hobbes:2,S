Oops, I sent too soon.  There's no mention of ACPI in the
Dell Precission 610.  There is mention of APM in the
dmesg though.

I forgot to mention, I compiled a version of linux-2.4.9-34 with
ACPI and APM enabled, and tarballed the kernel and modules, and
installed them on several intel machines.  They all successfully
did the soft-power-off, includeing a Dell Precission 610, which
is a dual-processor system.
