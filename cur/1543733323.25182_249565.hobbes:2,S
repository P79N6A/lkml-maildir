  If it could be done in userland, and still be accessible for most
  applications then that is great.
  If the user things that such a plugin is of value for him then I do
  not see why he should not be able to use it? Again these are example
  of stuff that could be done if there was a plugin/extensible
  interface.
  You make it sound like everything on the planet should be predefined
  and included in the kernel. This is not what I was saying or wanted.
  From what I understood from Hans, there will be a way to load
  plugins without having to recompile reiser4 module (or the kernel).
  This is what I'd like to see.
  Some things/plugins may even be partially user-space.
