Since this solution doens't solve Lisbor's request of using it on smb
filesystems, well, you could as well save up all of the programmer
cycles and use EVMS.
It has a pluggin for treating normal partitions as EVMS objets, so you
don't need to translate them or so; and with EVMS you can even use RW
snapshots.
