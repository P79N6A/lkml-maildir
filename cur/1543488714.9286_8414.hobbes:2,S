The whole concept of being up or down for various protocols in a good
idea in practice, but IMO the current ABI is broken. IMO, we should
be able to have zero or more protocols bound zero or more times to
each physical device... and kill the messy concept of virtual
interfaces.
Virtual interfaces on different networks only make life ugly for link
state protocols anyhow...
