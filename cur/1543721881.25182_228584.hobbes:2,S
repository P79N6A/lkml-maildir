well, the 5/6=stack 1/6=malloc rule in the RLIM_INFINITY can be changed. 
What would make the most sense - 1/2 for both?

it's been tripped over and the 5/6 rule was a fix for such a bugreport. 
What happens more in practice frequently is that someone needs a big
stack and sets the stack ulimit to RLIM_INFINITY.

the 128MB is 'wasted' to give some flexibility to the stack rlimits
changing runtime. But in practice it's far more important to have the
mmap()/malloc() space maximized and flexible than to give the stack
automatic flexibility.
