... and we are back to square one with racy instances of ->read() that
will use *pos twice, leaving a window for e.g. lseek() to invalidate
e.g. wraparound tests.  Not that deciding what to do at the end of
e.g. read() with lseek() happening in the middle would be fun anyway -
esp. since you don't remember the kind of seek it had been.
Go argue that with Linus.
