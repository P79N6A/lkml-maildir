Nothing "different" from the stock kernel; this is how all drivers are 
developed.  libata is the Serial ATA driver for Linux.  Some chipsets -- 
ICH5 and VIA SATA notably -- look so much like PATA that it's easy to 
let the existing drivers/ide driver use them.  You won't get SATA 
hotplug or similar SATA-only features, but as long as you can access 
your SATA hard drive, who cares?  :)
libata is in the "stock" 2.6 kernel, FWIW, too.
