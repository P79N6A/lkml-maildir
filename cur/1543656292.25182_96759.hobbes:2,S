don't many of the multi-CPU problems with tsc go away because you've got a
per-cpu physical page for the vsyscall?
i.e. per-cpu tsc epoch and scaling can be set on that page.
the only trouble i know of is what happens when an interrupt occurs and
the task is rescheduled on another cpu... in theory you could test %eip
against 0xfffffxxx and "rollback" (or complete) any incomplete
gettimeofday call prior to saving a task's state.  but i bet that test is
undesirable on all interrupt paths.
