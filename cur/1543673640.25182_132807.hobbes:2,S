Hi  guys,
 Here are the facts.
I have a small user program and the latest 2.4.20 stable kernel.
It is running on a board from IEI ( Wafer-5823 ) with a Cyrix 300 CPU.
 What happens is that after 2 hours of running this user program the 
computer 
freezes. I have the linux crash dump compiled inside the kernel and 
activated 
along with the magic sysrq key. Nothing works. I get only some messages 
inside 
the /var/log/messages but none of them are related to the crash ( modprobe 
says it 
can not load some module ). I also get the kcore file but I am using a 
bzImage  jkernel and I am not able to 
load it in the gdb. Should I switch to a vmlinux image ?
Any ideeas of how to move forward with this will be greatly appreciated.
Cheers,
Nicu
