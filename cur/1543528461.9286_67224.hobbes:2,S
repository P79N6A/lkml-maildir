I stand by my original response: 
"I know, I know; that was just a proof-of-concept hack to show what I wanted 
knfsd to do, and to encourage people to comment. It wasn't my intention that 
it would immediately get incorporated into the next nfs-utils release.
"I'll fix it as soon as I've got time to finish it properly."
Hopefully, that time is very soon, as the project which has been taking 110% 
of my working hours has now concluded.
