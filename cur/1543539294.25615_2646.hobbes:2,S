Well, for further speedup, you could bypass the filesystem layer
and use 2.4's new direct access support.  Your game can be stored
directly in a raw partition with your own custom format and
routines to speed up access - much like databases do.
You might consider making parts of the game loadable kernel
modules like "kmudgamed" for networking parts.  In a similar vein
to "khttpd" for webserving or "knfsd".
Hope this helps.
