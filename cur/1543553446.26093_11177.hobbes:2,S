2.4.0-test10 doesn't compile correctly on a mac.
Only 2 changes are necessary to make it work.
Or are there any bigger problems with the ppc arch?
the 2 changes:
in ./include/asm-ppc/param.h the following lines have to be added
right before the last #endif:
#ifdef __KERNEL__
# define CLOCKS_PER_SEC 100 /* frequency at which times() counts */
#endif
in ./drivers/input/keybdev.c the second #elif (CONFIG_ADB) or
something like that should be changed to #else or the correct #elif
statement.
I don't know who's the maintainer of the ppc arch - i think ibm has
taken it over or am i wrong about that?
