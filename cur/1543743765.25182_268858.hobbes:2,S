The OOM killer is only going to get triggered if kswapd is not able 
to make _any_ progress in all zones.  So it wont "fail balancing because there's 
a GFP_DMA allocation that eat the last dma page".  
As long as frees _one_ page during all passes from DEF_PRIORITY till priority=0, 
it wont kill any task. See?
I dont get your point.

I dont understand what you mean. "prevent oom-killing from a syscall allocation" ?

Isnt OOM killing all about the reclaiming efforts not being able to make progress?

To me having tasks trigger the OOM kill is fundamentally broken 
because it doesnt take into account kswapd page freeing 
efforts which are in-progress at the very moment.
That makes senses a lot of sense to me - would love to be proved
wrong.
See, its completly screwed right now. The code inside out_of_memory()
which only triggers OOM if it has happened several times during the 
past few seconds is horrible and shows how bad it is.
