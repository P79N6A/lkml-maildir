	Almost...  (someone correct me if I am wrong)
You need to patch /PATH/linux/include/linux/limits.h and
/PATH/linux/include/ARCH/param.h
with:
-#define NGROUPS                32
+#define NGROUPS                256
	Then patch glibc also with the same patch, otherwise it won't work. 
With glibc2, you need the patch the sources.  With glibc2.1 the
paramaters are gotten out of the running kernel (could be the kernel
source though).  When both are done you should be OK.  Try this on a
devel machine first!
ftp://admin.netus.com/OLD/glibc/glibc-2.0.7.NG265.patch
and
ftp://admin.netus.com/pub/hello
 is a quicky program to show the limits
sample:
[www@sc tmp]$ ./hello 
_SC_NGROUPS_MAX 256 end 
_SC_LOGIN_NAME_MAX 9 end
Num groups 78 end
I can't find the source to that right now though... :(
