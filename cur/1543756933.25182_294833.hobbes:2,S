how about something akin to
'You can only use the non-paying version of BK
 if you haven't worked on another SCM-system in the last year.'
So if I stop using BK, I can immediately start working on another SCM
but I can't go back to BK immediately.
That would be much more acceptable to me, I know what I did in the past,
but I won't accept any restriction of what I can do in the future.
There would still be a problem of what to do if I get addicted to BK.
