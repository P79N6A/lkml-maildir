yup, but that's better than 256+256, or 512+256 in -mm.
Your patch was kinda icky.  I think it would be better to remove those
page_state variables altogether and use something along the lines of
unsigned long __read_page_state(unsigned offset);
#define read_page_state(var) __read_page_state(offsetof(page_states, var))
I'll cook something up...
