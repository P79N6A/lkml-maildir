That's a good idea.  The other possibility I've thought of is maintaining a
list of the changes made to such a region and deapplying them / reapplying
them as the processes get scheduled.  That's probably fine as long as it's
just a few breakpoints and it's a single-CPU system.
But this is irrelevant as it doesn't address the sharing-prevention issue.

NOMMU doesn't with pages at this level, but deals with regions of memory
instead.  A mapping may be part of a page, a whole page, or several pages.
NOMMU private file mmap() allocates using kmalloc(), so if you allocate a
1-byte buffer, that's all you're guaranteed to get.
As it happens, when the code sees PT_PTRACED, the VMA is marked as being
unshareable by the simple expedient of turning off VM_MAYSHARE, meaning that it
neither shares with already existing mappings, nor will it be shareable by
mappings that have yet to be made - even within the same process.

Which brings us back to the if-statement you objected to.  Its presence is
still required so as to prevent sharing of the executable and loader, and this
seems a good a way to do it as any as far as I can see.  Remember that it has
be controlled by something that can be set before the binfmt load_binary() op
runs.
