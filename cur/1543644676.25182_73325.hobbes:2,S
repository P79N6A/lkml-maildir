With the current NGPT design your threads would be blocked (all that are 
scheduled
one this kernel vehicle).
With Scheduler Activations this could also be avoided.
The thread scheduler could get an upcall - but this will stay theory for 
a long
time on Linux.
But this is a somewhat far fetched example (for arguing for 1:1), isn't 
it?
There are other means of DoS..
