These will share cachelines of course, so the percpuification won't be very
effective.  I wonder if there's some way in which the nr_wired accounting
can be batched up and then dumped into a single per-zone counter when we
have the zone->lru_lock.
How come there are all those PageWired() tests in the LRU manipulation
functions?
