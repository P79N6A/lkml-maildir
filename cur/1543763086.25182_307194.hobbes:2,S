Well then, the verdict is reached.
My original design is based around storing related data in the same
block so that the track cache allows me to evade doing reads while I
poke around.
The design will stay the same; but the dependency on the track cache
will dissappear.  I'll simply consider 32KiB or 64KiB to be a nice block
size, 64KiB being the biggest, and leverage the design on the kernel
reading whole blocks into main memory to play with at a time.
Back to designing my file system. . . .
The only lasting regrets I have is that I don't have a good, fast way to
do on-disk locking for a cluster file system.  This would make my FS a
complete solution. . . .
It doesn't matter, finishing the design is a while off anyway.  I still
have to define several extended journal transaction types to support
fault tolerant dynamic resizing (grow, shrink) while running.  I don't
see how to grow left; shrinking from the left is easy enough.  Wait,
suddenly I see how to grow left:  Superblock at the end, and a bit of
magic. . . .

    Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be
    wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating
    new problems waiting out there.
