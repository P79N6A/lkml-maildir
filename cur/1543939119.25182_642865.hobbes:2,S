Well, sending a few signals (maybe to the top 5 processes in the OOM killer
list) is still a LOT better than OOM-killing them without warning...  That
way important system processes could be taught to understand SIGDANGER and
maybe do something about it instead of being killed, and if Firefox and
other memory hungry processes flush some of their cache it is not fatal.
I wouldn't think that SIGDANGER means "free all of your cache", since the
memory usage clearly wasn't a problem a few seconds previously, so as
an application writer I'd code it as "flush the oldest 10% of my cache"
or similar, and the kernel could send SIGDANGER again (or kill the real
offender) if the memory usage again becomes an issue.
Cheers, Andreas
