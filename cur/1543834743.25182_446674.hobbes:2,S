Tetsuo-san can you please use a correct "From:" field in your patch
postings?  Thank you.
This will allow me to form a correct attribution when I apply your
patches in the future.
This time I had to perform a lengthy web search to find who is behind
these strange from-${LIST_NAME}@i-love.sakura.ne.jp email addresses
:-((  Using these per-listname email addresses really makes things
painful for other developers, even though it might simplify things
for you.
Thanks again.
