Ehh.. Remind me again what the whole _point_ of physical IO was, in the
first place?
Was it maybe PERFORMANCE?
Yeah. I thought so. 
Bye, bye, performance. You might as well remove the whole thing
completely.
Also, note that one of my requirements to accept the direct IO patches in
the first place from Stephen was that I wanted them to NOT mess at all
with virtual memory mappings. Basically, the way kio buffers work is that
they are 100% based on only physical pages. There are no virtual issues at
all in the IO, and that's exactly how I want it. There is no reason to
confuse virtual addresses into this, because the thing should be usable
even in the complete absense of virtual mappings (ie the kernel can do
direct IO purely based on pages - think sendfile() etc).
What does this mean? It means that the notion of writing directly from
user space doesn't actually exist in the Linux implementation of direct IO
at all. What Linux direct IO does is really a two-phase operation:
 - look up the physical pages. 
 - do IO based on physical pages
The two are completely and entirely unrelated. Think "good design". Think
"modularity". Think "containment".
Which means, btw, that "virtual pinning" does not make sense from a
conceptual standpoint at all. Because the "virtual" part does not even
_exist_ by the time we do IO.

And WHY do you want to pin the damn things virtually in the first place?
Your bug is a non-issue: it can obviously be fixed other ways, and has
nothing to do with virtually pinning the page. Yes, pinning the page in
the virtual map would also fix it,  but at the cost of completely breaking
the whole idea of what direct IO is all about.
