Just doing hdX=scsi would have been enough, however. Except it doesn't 
work (currently) if ide-scsi is a module.
I agree with Alan that the problem is the grab-on-load strategy that
ide-scsi (and ide-cd for that matter) uses. I am willing to look into 
changing that to grab-on-open but I'm not sure if the change is an 
appropriate one for a stable series kernel -- it looks pretty non-trivial.
