Subject: [GIT PULL, resend] async_tx/dmaengine update for 2.6.29
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus, please pull from:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djbw/async_tx.git next
...to receive:
0) More code removed than added
1) Channel allocation rework
The dmaengine subsystem collects and advertises dma channels for two
classes of users in the kernel, memory-to-memory offload and traditional
device-to-memory DMA.  The original design was driven by the
memory-to-memory case and is starting to show its limitations now that
more device-to-memory DMA users are appearing.  The primary difference
between the two classes is that memory-to-memory offload is very
amenable to channel sharing and is tolerant of dynamic channel changes.
Compare this to the device-to-memory case where a channel must be
dedicated to a device and may have platform-specific reasons why it
cannot talk to a different device.
This rework allows channels to be targeted to a public mem-to-mem pool
or be reserved for an exclusive (private) dev-to-mem allocation.
2) Fixes for dmaengine
Stephen Hemminger pointed out that the dmaengine sysfs implementation
was broken.  It now has a proper ->release() routine.
3) Fixes for ioat
The previous channel allocation scheme covered a shutdown bug.
4) Fixes for iop-adma
Some devm fixups, and module removal enablement.
These commits have been in linux-next since mid December, although I bit
the bullet and rebased recently to cover a git-bisect breakage case.
This was caused by net-next-2.6.git moving a routine that was deleted by
this branch. Thanks to Stephen Rothwell for pointing this out.
Thanks!
Dan
