Sorry, what I meant is that if the select() did filled the structure itself,
it would avoid a supplementary call (syscall+hw access). And I'm certain
that select() accesses the same information at some time.

Indeed, this is much !

Just a thought : have you tried to check whether it's the recovery time
after a read or read itself which takes time ? I mean, perhaps one read
would take, say 50 ns, but two back-to-back reads will take 2 us. If
this is the case, having a separate function with only one read for
non-broken chipsets will be better because there might be no particular
reasons to check the counter that often.
Other thought : is it possible to memory-map this timer to avoid the slow
inl() on x86 ?
