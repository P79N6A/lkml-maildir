Hi all,
There seems to be a major problem with the promise drivers.
It is detected and seems to work, but there is a very 
large number of interrupts being generated:
adamm@polaris:/proc$ cat interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:    2727665    2683676    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:          1          1    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  5:    1137650    1130539   IO-APIC-level  eth0
  7:          0          0    IO-APIC-edge  soundblaster

adamm@polaris:/proc$ uptime

Or a staggering ~40000 interrupts per second!
This is a dual PPro machine and it is using 30% cpu time
just to handle the interrupts.
Anyone know what is going on?
Thanks,
Adam
