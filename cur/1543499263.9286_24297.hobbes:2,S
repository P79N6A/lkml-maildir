Oh, well... Looks like it's a really borderline case - everybody seem to
be doing whatever they want here. In situations when the last component is
a link and call normally wouldn't follow it adding slashes seems to be
ignored on Solaris and forces the link expansion on Linux and 4.4BSD...
I still think that following the link is bogus, but after all, if somebody
wants to hang let's give him the rope...
