acpi=off makes linux hang and not continuing booting. Hm, syslog does
not contain the trace until that crash but the last lines before the
hanging are:
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: USB 2.0 initialized, EHCI 1.00, driver 10 Dec 2004
hub 1-0:1.0: USB hub found
I've tried booting the kernel with parameter irqpoll as you have
suggested but it leads to a kernel panic.
The last line was:
kernel panic - not syncing: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
It's not saved in syslog too, so is there any way to get the trace to a
file?
There is something other I've tested - perhaps it's usefull for you.
I've turned off the power options in my ami bios and linux hangs for a
long time while booting.
I got messages like:
...
ide-cd: cmd 0x5a timed out
hdb: lost interrupt
hdb: lost interrupt
hdb: lost interrupt
ide-cd: cmd 0x5a timed out
hdb: lost interrupt
hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdb: lost interrupt
hdb: lost interrupt
...
After 30minutes I did a restart and set the bios power options back to:
Repost Video on S3 Resume [yes]
ACPI 2.0 Support          [yes]
ACPI APIC support         [enabled]
