There's a fair bit of material on this at
	
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/ext3/ext3-usage.html
executive summary:
	- use latest util-linux and e2fsprogs
	- Make the root fs have fstype `ext3' in /etc/fstab
	- Make the others `auto'
	- Alternatively, use "ext3,ext2" in fstab.
The problem is that various tools (mount, fsck, df, others?)
make various assumptions about what to do when certain
filesystem types are encountered in fstab.  It's been a bit
painful.
