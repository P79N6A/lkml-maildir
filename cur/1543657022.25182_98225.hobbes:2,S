That would be 432000 rotations per second, meaning that the
edge of a 3.5" disk would travel at almost 120 kilometers per
second and be stressed by some pretty impressive G forces,
which I'm too lazy to calculate.
Good thing a 7200 RPM disk only spins 120 times a second,
that's a lot safer in consumer applications. ;)
