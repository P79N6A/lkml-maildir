Guys,
What's the best way to get a large region of DMA'able memory for use
with framegrabbers and other greedy drivers?
Per a thread on glx-dev, Andi Kleen mentions that the new 2.3.x MM stuff
still doesn't allieviate the need for bigphysarea and similar patches.
Is there there any way a driver can improve its chance of getting a
large region of memory?  ie. can it tell the system to force out user
pages to make memory available, etc.
Thanks,
	Jeff
