The suggestion that was made to allow different implementations of the
"capabilitys exist for this file" bit for different filesystems sounded
like it was on the right track, it allows for filesystem support where it
is feasable, and allows for workarounds to be implemented for other
filesystems without having to change the entire filesystem. When the NFS
client is modified to use the sticky bit as the caps bit it should get the
squash_sticky default as well. That keeps things secure by default but
allows for exceptions to be made as the administrators of a particular
site deem it nessasary.

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
