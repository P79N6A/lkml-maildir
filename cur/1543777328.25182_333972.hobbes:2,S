No, that doesn't hold water either.  We already jigger jiffie to be _close_ to 
1/HZ and closer still to what we can get from the PIT as its true period (for 
example, today the jiffie is 999849 nanoseconds) and this too is only accurate 
to the nanosecond.  Here are the jiffie values for several HZ values using the 
formulas in the code which use the TICK_RATE as given by the hardware.  Note the 
error here is the difference between an asked for repeating timer of 1 second 
and what the system clock on the same system says, NOT what real time is in 
either case, just relative between the two.  In otherwords, if you set up an 
itimer to signal every second and looked at the long term drift between the 
signals it gives and the system clock you would see the itimer drifting by 
~914ppm (with HZ = 846).
HZ  	TICK RATE	jiffie(ns)	second(ns)	 error (ppbillion)
  100	 1193182	10000000	1000000000	       0
  200	 1193182	 5000098	1000019600	   19600
