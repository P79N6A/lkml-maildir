Hmm, works for me here.  But then, i386_start_kernel -> reserve_ebda_region
->printk already, so that banner is *still* not first line.

That won't help much, since a failed kernel parameter parse will also call
printk.  I don't think it's sane to call start_kernel without the
ability to do integer division!
