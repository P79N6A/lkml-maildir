Well, I am sure that someone will at least take the problem I have
serious and will give me a good alternative to get things working,
which isnt always the case with mickeysoft :D
But again, yes, I do agree that if someone/something decides to reduce
my transferspeed I should have an option to override that decision or
tell the thing not to make that decision.
