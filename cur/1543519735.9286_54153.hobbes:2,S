Hello:
Per advice from Doug Ledford I'm posting this here, as he doesn't feel
its a SCSI issue.
Recently on the LInux box I'm running I'm seeing oops usually during
periods of heavy SCSI activity such as a copy or tape back up or if a
program writes/reads alot of data. 
Specifics:
Linux 2.2.13
256MB RAM
Celeron 333 Processor
Adaptec 2910B Controller
Disk Drives:
hda: SAMSUNG SV0844A, ATA DISK drive
hdb: FX240S, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdc: WDC AC32500H, ATA DISK drive
SCSI DISK ID #1 sda: SEAGATE   Model: ST32550N   Rev: 0021
Tape Auto Changer ID#3 HP        Model: C1553A  Rev:NS01
Included below are 2 dmesg and the results from running through
ksymoops.
Any suggestions or thoughts appreciated, this used to be a rock solid
system.
George
