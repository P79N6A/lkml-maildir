I'm not sure about "affected" drives, but the issue as Jeff pointed
out is that SI3112/3114 send write data to the host in non-multiples
of 512 bytes, if the command exceeds 15 LBAs in size.
Up to 15*512 bytes gives you a single FIS of 15*512, for anything
larger they have an internal algorithm that is pretty easy to figure
out with a bus trace.
To work with drives that aren't capable of handling this, you can't
issue writes > 15 LBAs to the drive, hence the blacklist/workaround.
