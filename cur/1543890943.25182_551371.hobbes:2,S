Temporarily, yes. All this only works when averaged out.  The basic
idea is that you want a constant upper bound on the difference between
the CPU time a task receives and the CPU time it was intended to get.
This discretization is one of the larger sources of the "error" in the
CPU time granted. The constant upper bound usually only applies to the
largest difference for any task. When absolute values of differences
are summed across tasks the aggregate will be O(tasks) because there's
something almost like a constant per-task lower bound a la Heisenberg.
It would have to get more exact the more tasks there are on the system
for that to work, and something of the opposite actually holds.
It might be appropriate for the scheduler to dynamically adjust a
periodic timer's period or to set up one-shot timers at involuntary
preemption times in order to achieve more precise fairness in this
sort of situation. In the case of few preemption points such one-shot
code or low periodicity code would also save on taking interrupts that
would otherwise manifest as overhead.
In short, a user with many tasks can reap a temporary advantage
relative to users with fewer tasks because of this, but over time,
longer-running tasks will receive the CPU time intended to within
some constant upper bound, provided other things aren't broken.
