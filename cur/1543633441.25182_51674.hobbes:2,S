Sounds like kbuild 2.5 is more a feature bloated Big Brother Build System.
The serial stuff has moved in the -rmk tree, and the above drivers/char
is no longer relevant.  Removing it and the other ARM serial drivers
in drivers/char would make the -rmk patches smaller. 8)
The keyboard driver for the Linkup Systems L7200 stuff was never merged.
People keep talking about fixing that, but seems that no one has the
information to write such a thing, and Steven Hill (iirc) has since
moved onto greater things.  I believe people do use Linux on L720x
without the keyboard driver though!
However, since the ARM community is mostly centred around embedded stuff,
it is impossible to judge the size or use of any part of the ARM Linux
kernel.  It's also gradually sliding towards a completely closed, non-
sharing development community.
