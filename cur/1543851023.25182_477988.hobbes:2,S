Well, we have to do *something* about those devices that don't have
fixed units (see my mail to Greg from a few minutes ago), so which
alternative do you prefer?

The latter. Yes, writing is not as convenient as reading; but the same
drawback exists in the other two suggestions for dynamic units - you
still have to read another attribute, or parse a filename, to get the
units.
The "capacity_remaining:mV" option at least saves you the parsing if
your're only interested in mV readouts. But battery gauge applets, for
examples, shouldn't be hardcoded to specific units, so they will have
to do the filename parsing dance.
