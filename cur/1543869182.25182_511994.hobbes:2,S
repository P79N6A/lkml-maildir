If you really care, add a a call to backlight_update_status() after you
set the brightness attribute like some of the other drivers have. The
only data you're changing are single numbers and as long as
update_status is called afterwards, a consistent state is pushed to the
hardware so there is no race problem.

Have a look at what corgi_bl does. It can know what state it set the
hardware too as it keeps track itself, it just can't read that state
from the hardware. Note how there is extra code in it to handle a power
limit on the backlight under certain conditions and how this is fed back
through the class through the get_brightness method.
Adding one line of code (admittedly slight more due to error handling),
is hardly that much code duplication.

I wasn't aware of this problem. If some devices need bits from both
raedon/whatever and acpi, the current implementations are just plain
wrong. Its not really a backlight class problem and more of an
implementation and interaction problem between acpi and the framebuffer
drivers. They should be presenting and registering *one* backlight class
device, not two. Without knowing more about the circumstances and
how/when to combine which drivers its hard for me to help further...
