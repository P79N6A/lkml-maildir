This sounds like a problem I had with one modem a while back, where
the modem sometimes started up with basically random settings. I
learned from that to always start any autodial scripts with AT&Fx
suitable for that modem - usually AT&F0 but on some modems AT&F1
instead.
I then wait for the OK response, then pause for at least a second
(some modems need a pause after sending the OK response to the AT&F
command for some reason), then send the commands needed to tweak the
settings to those desired, breaking each line to be not more than 31
characters since some modems ignore commands longer than that.
Finally, I use the following dial string:
	ATX4TDxxx
This sets the correct results mode in the dial command, as required by
some modems, and it also movs the selection of tone dialling out of
the dial string, thus ensuring that the stupidly low limits on dial
string lengths of some modems aren't needlessly compromised...
Best wishes from Riley.
