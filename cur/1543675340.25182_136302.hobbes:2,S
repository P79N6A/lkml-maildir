Yeah, but there is an improvement of a greater magnitude in do_mmap_pgoff
...by about 190 ticks. There is a regression of about 60 ticks in 
unmap_region (taking standard deviation into consideration).  Change
in ticks for do_brk is not statistically significant.

I agree with this for vm_unacct_memory, since it is called from many
places.  Based on the workload, nos could be different (if all the
callsites are called with comparable frequency).   
However, if the workload is such that one particular caller is
stressed much more than other callers, then, maybe inlining  helps 
as in this case where do_mmap_pgoff is stresed more?

Sounds reasonable.  I'll give this a run and see how the profiles look.
