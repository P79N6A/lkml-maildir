Hardware designers need only be concerned with how things -appear-
to the software.  They can and do use optimizations that get the
effect of waiting without actually waiting.  For example, an x86
CPU need not -really- keep writes ordered as long as the software
cannot tell that they have become misordered.  This may sound
strange, but one important example would be a CPU doing writes that
are to variables that it knows do not appear in any other CPU's 
cache.  In this sort of case, the CPU could reorder the writes until
such time as it detected a request from another CPU requsting a
cache line containing one of the variables.

Potentially many things in both cases:
o	Fetching the store instruction that will do the write.
o	Determining that all instructions whose execution logically
	precedes the write are free of fatal errors (e.g., page
	faults, exceptions, traps, ...).
o	Determining the exact value that is to be written (which might
	have been computed by prior instructions).
o	Determining the exact address that is to be written to (which
	also might have been computed by prior instructions).
o	Determining that the store instruction itself is free of
	fatal errors.  Note that it might be necessary to compute
	the address to be sure.
o	Determining that no hardware interrupt will precede the
	completion of the store instruction.
o	Storing the value to one of the CPU's write buffers (which
	is not yet in the coherence region represented by the CPU's
	cache).
o	Starting the process of fetching the cache line into which
	the value is to be stored.
o	Starting the process of invalidating the corresponding cache
	line from all the other CPUs' caches.
o	Receiving the cache line into which the value is to be stored.
o	Storing the value to the CPU's cache, which involves combining
	the value to be written with the rest of the cache line.
o	Responding to the first request for the corresponding cache
	line from some other CPU.
o	Completing the process of invalidating the corresponding cache
	line from all the other CPUs' caches.  Note that Alpha's
	weak memory-barrier semantics allow this step to complete
	long after the value is stored into the writing CPU's cache.
o	Storing the value to physical DRAM.
Most of these steps can execute in parallel or out of order.  And a
CPU designer would gleefully point out -lots- of steps I have omitted,
some for the sake of brevity, others out of ignorance.

Yes, maintaining one's sanity requires taking a very simplified view
of memory ordering, especially since no two CPUs order memory references
in exactly the same way.

Remember that smp_mb() is officially about controlling the order in
which values are communicated between the CPU executing the smp_mb()
and the interconnect, -not- between a pair of CPUs.  In the general
case (which includes Alpha), controlling the order in which values
are communicated from one CPU to another requires that -both- CPUs
execute memory barriers.

Very good!
And this is in fact why smp_wmb() and friends also contain must directives
instructing the compiler not to mess with ordering.
