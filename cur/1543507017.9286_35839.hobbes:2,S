To whom it may concern.  I appreciate the addition of the sb1000 cable
modem driver in the main kernel.  I have 2 questions about the driver:
1. Can someone make it report in /proc/net/dev the amount of bytes that
is received throught this interface?
2. Can their be a convenient way of READ_DATA_PORT since mine isnt the
default? (This is just a convenince factor for me, Ive already forgot
to do this a few times :)
