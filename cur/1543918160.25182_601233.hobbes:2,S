That's 2.6.24 ... and that's not what I said.  I said I wanted to take
it via scsi-misc into 2.6.24 and then take it via the stable tree for
2.6.23.x

Sure, I'll state my case:  This is a bug, but it has no affected users,
nor will it because the aic94xx doesn't work on non-x86 architectures by
reason of other longstanding bugs (and TODEVICE/FROMDEVICE only matters
to architecures which use dma_map_sg to program the IOMMU).  Given that
we're at -rc9 and counting every patch towards stabilisation, I see no
benefit to adding this to the tree because the benefit to users is zero
and the detriment from code churn at this stage is potentially non-zero.
My recommendation is still to follow what I propose: take it via
scsi-misc to 2.6.24-rc1 and then back to 2.5.23.x
