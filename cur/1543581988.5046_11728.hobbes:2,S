Umm, I think I said that too early. I begun to have problem even during
boot; the scsi bios did recognize the drive, but the bios didn't find the
boot record. This was completely cured by forcing the drive to 80MB/s mode.
So I think the cable wasn't Ultra160 capable.
However, the 2.4.1ac6, 2.4.1ac2 and 2.19pre6 aic7xxx.c still had trouble
with the drive. I went back to 80MB/s, 40MB/s and even 20MB/s, but that
still didn't help. 2.4.1* reported time out while waiting for a command and
would go into an endless loop resetting the bus. 2.2.19pre6 said there was
an error during the data in phase, but after some coughing it booted up and
seemed to work quite alright.
NT4 booted up without and visible problems.
The HP service guy changed the motherboard (integrated scsi) the cable (to
another (80MB/s one), and the drive logics, but that didn't help.
The problems first started after the motherboard was first changed (due to
separate problem.) The new one had newer bios and scsi bios.
Anyhow, I just compiled 2.4.1ac13 with Justin Gibbs's aic7xxx, and it does
not suffer of any problem at 80MB/s.
