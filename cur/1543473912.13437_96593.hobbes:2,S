Not yet.
There is no reason why the FBDev driver should'nt do hardware acceleration
from userspace like the SVGA Server does today.  For some hardware this
already works, see Geert's mail.

For newer boards (like matrox) which use the XFree86 XAA Architecture it
might be easier make SVGA Server framebuffer aware instead of adding
acceleration support for these boards to the FBDev Server.  I'm currently
looking into this...
It more that "just a new option", the initialisation is
completely different if you are running on top of a Framebuffer device.
The acceleration code might work without modification.
