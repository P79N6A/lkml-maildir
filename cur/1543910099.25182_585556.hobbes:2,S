openSUSE 10.2 used a whitelist of buses which trigger module loading.
It's in the udev sysconfig. rules and /sbin/hwup.
The easiest is probably to add a rule for that bus:
  ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="ssb", ENV{MODALIAS}=="?*",
RUN+="/sbin/modprobe $env{MODALIAS}"
openSUSE 10.3 will call modprobe directly, the whitelist and the whole
hwup logic is removed in the meantime.
