Can't we just do something like:
/* KERNEL_PRIVATE_BEGIN: blah */
struct internal organs(int foo, char *bar);
/* KERNEL_PRIVATE_END */
sort of thing? That way glibc people can use sed to eliminate bogons
and confilcts and they can also submit patches for areas of overlap
the kernel people miss --- without fear of breaking the kernel?
Seems win-win to me and stops glibc and kernel developers from having
to trip over people and will allow us to eliminate all the rediculous
numbers of __KERNEL__ checks.
