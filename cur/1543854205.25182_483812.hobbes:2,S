Yes, that is true. However that would involve adding support for This 
Situation to the parent process. Which is where it becomes tricky. Patch 
/sbin/init, in case the daemon runs like everything else. Or patch 
xinetd, in case it is run from within that. Or, ...
  The 'problem' with the waitpid solution is that you would need to 
patch every possible parent that may become the owner of The Sigkilled 
Target.
