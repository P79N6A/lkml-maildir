I'm getting some build errors on ppc64 in drivers/char/hvc_console.c
  CC      drivers/char/hvc_console.o
drivers/char/hvc_console.c: In function `hvc_poll':
drivers/char/hvc_console.c:600: error: `count' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/char/hvc_console.c:600: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/char/hvc_console.c:600: error: for each function it appears in.)
drivers/char/hvc_console.c:636: error: structure has no member named `flip'
make[1]: *** [drivers/char/hvc_console.o] Error 1
make: *** [_module_drivers/char] Error 2
The count undeclared one was easy to fix but I coldn't fix the filp
structure element in 2-3 minutes so I'm punting.
Anyone have a patch to fix this driver?
Sonny
