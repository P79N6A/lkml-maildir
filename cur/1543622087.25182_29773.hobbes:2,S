FWIW, the irqrate-A1 patch from the -slb/-jam series kernels
(2.4.18-rc1-slb2 through 2.4.18-rc2-jam1 for certain) seems to make one of
my computers (a dual 1GHz PIII, Iwill DVD266-R motherboard) hang when I
access the floppy drive. I don't believe this happens on other
(uniprocessor, not SMP) machines I have here, although I'm not certain
about that. This is 100% reproducible.
This bug report is probably rather vague, but I probably won't have time
for anything more detailed or any debugging activities related to this for
several weeks, and I hope this report is better than nothing.
