It was probably the first version of the patch for device-mapper which
we got into SLE10, but it changed to "change" in the upstream kernel,
after we all met at OLS and talked about it.

It was in the Czech Republic, but we got a few beers... :) And in the
"virtual md devices" conversation.

No, there isn't. The thing is, that "online/offline" need to be always
symmetric in it's order. There can't be two "online" events without an
"offline" event. We decided at OLS for the device-mapper events, that we
can't be sure, that there will always be "online/offline" sequences and
can't be sure to make them always match the right sequence. Therefore we
decided to go for a simple "change", and let userspace find out the
current state of the device if needed.

We couldn't think of any use of an "offline" event. So we removed the
event when the device-mapper device is suspended.

The current idea is to send only a "change" event if something happens
that makes it necessary for udev to reinvestigate the device, like
possible filesystem content that creates /dev/disk/by-* links.
Finer grained device-monitoring is likely better placed by using the
poll() infrastructure for a sysfs file, instead of sending pretty
expensive uevents. 
Udev only hooks into "change" and revalidates all current symlinks for
the device. Udev can run programs on "online", but currently, it will
not update any /dev/disk/by-* link, if the device changes its content.

Yeah, "online/offline" sounds nice, but it will get messy, if you have a
case where you don't need to go offline, but still want to notify a
change ... :)

Sure, it's just software, it definitely could be made to match on
anything. It's just that "change" already works fine today. :)
