And this is exactly why I designed it as is: NOT to do anything that
anyone can imagine. This is the reason why most of the filesystem
unification approaches fail: too much unnecessary complexity.

You just unmount the topmost writable layer and replace it by a clean
tmpfs. There you go. Removing a file and not creating a whiteout
totally breaks what the user of the filesystem expects.
BTW: Undoing your changes to source code is solved by many
applications: patch, backup files, version control systems ...

You want per systemcall policies of what layer is affected??? Crazy
idea but how do you do this without letting the user know of what
layer the file is in the first place. This doesn't work without major
extension of the VFS/syscall interface.

I don't think so. Plan9 union directory semantic is different. Plan9
is different.
I'll stick to the conventional UNIX semantics since I think that
otherwise it will just make this thing too complex. First we need to
solve the existing problems like union readdir, bind mounts and
whiteout handling. If this is all solved and you are disappointed with
what you can achieve with only the topmost layer writable feel free to
come up with trivial extensions :)
Cheers,
