/dev/mapper/raid10-data is a LV taking 200GB of a 280GB VG ("raid10") with
a single PV in it:  /dev/sdb1 -- ips driver, IBM ServeRAID 6M card,
representing a RAID 10 atop 8 SCSI disks.
I just made a new kernel without NUMA and made a filesystem on /dev/sdb1
directly instead of using LVM and it worked fine, if not a little slowly.
Now that I know it /can/ work, I'll try and narrow down whose fault it is:
NUMA or LVM.
