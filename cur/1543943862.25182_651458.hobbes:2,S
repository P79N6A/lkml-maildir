Subject: [PATCH] vmsplice exploit fix (was: splice: fix user pointer access in get_iovec_page_array)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Kudos to all involved in the rapid response.  But.
Information on patching this vulnerability is not available front and 
center in many of the places you would expect: kernel.org front page, 
debian.org front page, covered on planet.debian.org but without a 
pointer to the patch, and so on.  So this post provides a subject line 
for Google to find, and for good measure mentions the word 
vulnerability.
Also,
   
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=464953
I think many users would first go to kernel.org on a day like today, as 
I did.  Nothing to see there.  We could do a way better job of getting 
the word out.
Patch attached as posted above by Pekka.  For the mortals among us:
   cd linux-2.6.recent && patch <fix.vmsplice.exploit.patch -p1
Regards,
Daniel

Bastian, can I have your Signed-off-by for this, please? Oliver, Niki, can
