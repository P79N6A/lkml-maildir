Why did your numbers differ from the numbers that were used in the 
upstream kernel?
The Alpha maintainers (Cc's added) might now better what happened here.

These syscalls were added in 2.6.22, not 2.6.23, and are therefore in 
the officially released kernel since more than two months.
Changing a userspace ABI that has already been part of an officially 
released kernel because someone patched other syscall numbers into his 
private kernel doesn't sound like a good solution.
