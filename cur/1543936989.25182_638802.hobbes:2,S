The tx code has an "early exit" that tries to limit the amount of tx
packets handled in a single poll loop and requires napi or interrupt
rescheduling based on the return value from e1000_clean_tx_irq.
see this code in e1000_clean_tx_irq
4005 #ifdef CONFIG_E1000_NAPI
4006 #define E1000_TX_WEIGHT 64

I think that is probably related.  For a test you could apply the
original patch, and remove this "break" just by commenting out line
4008.  This would guarantee all tx work is cleaned at every e1000_clean
