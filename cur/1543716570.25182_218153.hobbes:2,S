It looks ok, but somehow defeats the whole purpose of having separate
include files. Someday we may consolidate all the time related things
into just one ore two header files then.

I wonder whether it's conceptually correct to use jiffies for accurate 
long-time measurements at all. ntpd is there for a reason. Using both
corrected, accurate and freely running clocks IMHO is calling for trouble. 
This might be something to think about for 2.7.
