Tried 2.4.1ac13 vanilla. Still a no-go:
SCSI host 0 abort (pid 0) timed out - resetting
SCSI bus is neing reset for host 0 channel 0
(scsi0:0:0:0) Synchronous at 40.0MBytes/s offset 31
SCSI host 0 abort (pid 0) timed out - trying harder
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0
(scsi0:0:0:0) Synchronous at 40.0MBytes/s offset 31
scsi: aborting command due to timeout pid 0 scsi 0 channel 0 id 0 lun 0
Read (10) 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 00
SCSI SIGI 0x14 SEDADDR 0x77 SSTAT 0x0 SSTAT 0x2 SG_CACHEPTR 0x6 SSTAT2 0xC0 ST 0x0F0
(copied by hand, so please excuse the typos.)
Although 2.4.1ac13+Gibbs's aic7xxx seems to work perfectly, I still
wouldn't count out the possibility a hardware fault of some kind, since the
box already begun failing to find the boot record at 80MB/sec as well.
