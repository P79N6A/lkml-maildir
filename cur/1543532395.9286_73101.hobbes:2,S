By adding 
append = "ppa=0x378 parport=0x378,7,3 opl3sa2=0x370,5,1,0,0x530,0x330 "
into my lilo.conf sound will now work just after a reboot.   But after
a suspend/resume cycle I can't get any sound out of the computer.
Gom seems to think that there are still mixer controls available, but
they don't make any difference.
The computer is a Toshiba Satellite Pro 445CDX.
The only sound related lines I find in my log files are:
