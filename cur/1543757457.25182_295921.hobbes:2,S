Hi all,
there's something I don't understand:  With IRQBALANCE *enabled* almost
all interrupts are processed on CPU0.  This changed in an unexpected way
after disabling IRQBALANCE: now all interrupts are distributed uniformly
to both CPUs.  Maybe it's intentional, but it's not what I expect when a
config option named IRQBALANCE is *disabled*.
Can anybody comment on this?
Thanks,
-jo
