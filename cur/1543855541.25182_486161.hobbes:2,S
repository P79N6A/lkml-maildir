Hi,
Actually, this has been discussed on the MUSCLE mailing list (as implied 
in the ubuntu bug report): I've upgraded the driver to be compiled on 
2.6.17. It works fine (even better actually) with 2.6.18 and 2.6.19.
Latest version I've published is there:
http://pieleric.free.fr/o2scr/
Since then, I've cleaned up the code a bit, but no bug fix. I'll try to 
update the version when I'm back home today ;-)
Actually, I've never submitted the driver to the LKML mainly due to lack 
of test. I don't have any usable smartcard to check that everything 
works. If you could confirm it works, or tell me where it fails, it 
would be great!
c u,
Eric
