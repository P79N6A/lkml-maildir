Subject: [PATCH] ktime_t overflow from sys_nanosleep
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/27/28

On systems where longs are 64 bits, nanosleep can pass a timespec with
tv_sec larger than 18446744073 (approx 2^34), which is then multiplied 
by NSEC_PER_SEC and stuffed into a single s64 by ktime_set in
hrtimer_nanosleep. This overflows of course, and causes the sleep to
return early (instantly if you set the timespec to its maximum).
(this gets triggered by doing a "sleep inf" with the sleep from the
gnu coreutils).
I can think of two solutions, either increase the size of ktime_t to
something larger than 64 bits, which would probably bring along a host
of issues and and lose the entire point of having a single scalar, or
we can limit the range of sys_nanosleep, which is simple, but will have
to be documented and sleep(1) will still need fixing.
I've put the check in timespec_valid in the attached patch. This will
limit the range of timespecs in general, but since most of them seem
to end up as ktime_t's anyway, it seems like a reasonable precaution.
