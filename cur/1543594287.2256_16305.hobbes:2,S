Ok, I capitulate ;)
So basically, all is needed is to enforce those drivers to use
ioremap before doing their IOs.
I still think there's a potential difficulty with having the same
ioremap function for both MMIO and PIO as the address space may overlap.
For once, the x86 enters the dance as it has really separate bus spaces for
them. Other archs can work around this by using the physical address
where the PIO is mapped in the IO resources.
