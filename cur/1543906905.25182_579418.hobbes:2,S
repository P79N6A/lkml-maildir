Hello Serge,
In 2.6.23-rc, your patch to add support for CLONE_NEWUSER is included.  Is
there there some for-userland-programmers documentation of this flag
somewhere?  Would you be able to send some documentation to me (ideally as
a patch to the clone.2 man page, but otherwise some plain text will do).
If this flag is also supported for unshare(), then could you please send me
a patch/text for that too?
Cheers,
Michael
