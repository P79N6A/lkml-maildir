When I tried it, I was running 2.6.0-test4.  The RAID5 was 4 120 GB
Seagate disks on a Highpoint controller.  On top of that, I had LVM,
with ext3 fs.  After just minutes, strange things started happening to
files.  Some had random bits changed in the inode, others were just
trashed.  e2fsck complained a great deal.
I went back to 2.4.21, which is working OK.  A couple of things bother
me, though.  In the dmesg output there are many of these:
raid5: switching cache buffer size, 8192 --> 1024
raid5: switching cache buffer size, 1024 --> 4096
raid5: switching cache buffer size, 4096 --> 1024
raid5: switching cache buffer size, 1024 --> 4096
raid5: switching cache buffer size, 4096 --> 1024
ISTR reading somewhere, that this has a bad impact on performance.
The other thing that I don't like, is the performance of the RAID
array.  The disks individually give ~40 MB/s read speed, but the array
only measures 25 MB/s.  I was of the impression, that RAID5 would give
read speeds at least equal to the underlying disks.  Is this
incorrect?
