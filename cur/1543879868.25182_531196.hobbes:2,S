Subject: [patch 00/10]  mount ownership and unprivileged mount syscall (v3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset adds support for keeping mount ownership information in
the kernel, and allow unprivileged mount(2) and umount(2) in certain
cases.
This can be useful for the following reasons:
- mount(8) can store ownership ("user=XY" option) in the kernel
  instead, or in addition to storing it in /etc/mtab.  For example if
  private namespaces are used with mount propagations /etc/mtab
  becomes unworkable, but using /proc/mounts works fine
- fuse won't need a special suid-root mount/umount utility.  Plain
  umount(8) can easily be made to work with unprivileged fuse mounts
- users can use bind mounts without having to pre-configure them in
  /etc/fstab
The following security measures are taken for unprivileged mounts:
 - only allow submounting under mounts which have a special mount flag set
 - only allow mounting on files/directories writable by the user
 - limit the number of user mounts
 - force "nosuid,nodev" mount options
Changes from the previous submissions:
 - add mount flags to set/clear mnt_flags individually
 - add "usermnt" mount flag.  If it is set, then allow unprivileged
   submounts under this mount
 - make max number of user mounts default to 1024, since now the
   usermnt flag will prevent user mounts by default
