Sure.  But, the interface changes present in scsi-misc-2.6, notably:
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-misc-2.6.git;a=commit;h=19a7b4aebf9ad435c69a7e39930338499af4d152
obviate the need for the explicit '#include' -- there are no longer
any explicit calls to the fc_remote_port_*() functions within
qla_rscn.c.
