But unprivileged proceses are not only created through login.  What
happens, when some process does setuid(NONZERO).  With your proposal
it now gained the privilege of mounting in the initial namespace.  IOW
every program calling setuid() now has to be audited for any problems
this could cause.

Umm, well.  What if user mounts a filesystem read-only.  Then wants to
unmount, but hey, it's read-only, no permission to write, no
unmount...
That's just a stupid example, but it shows, that file permissions are
not always useful for determining what you can mount, and especially
what you can unmount.

That rules out unprivileged bind mounts.

Checking the permissions on the mountpoint to allow unmounting is
  - rather inelegant: user can't see those permissions, can only
    determine if umount is allowed by trial and error
  - may be a security hole, e.g.:
      sysadmin:
          mkdir -m 777 /mnt/disk
          mount /dev/hda2 /mnt/disk
Of course the user doesn't have the right to delete the contents of
the mount, yet the permissions on the mountpoint would imply that s/he
has permission to umount the disk.

Yup, that would work.  Accounting only unprivileged mounts may be more
intuitive though:
