Hi,
I've just posted a new portscan detection module to netfilter mailing
list. This module is used inside of linux 2.4 netfilter architecture and
will attempt to detect TCP and UDP port scans and log them to
the syslog.
For download, please see the netfilter mailing list or our product
download site at
