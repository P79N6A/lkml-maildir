If you implement it wrongly sure. If you implemented it right then
this occurs.
User 1 queues 20 ms of 3D commands
User 1 is pre-empted
User 2 wants the 2D engine
User 2 beings wait for 2D
User 2 sleeps
User 1 wakes
User 1 beings wait for 3D but discovers a claim is in progress
User 1 sleeps
User 2 wakes, runs commands
If you have DRI loaded then as you rightly say the obvious desired
outcome is that the fb engine either turns acceleration off or switches
to using the DRI layer. 
But this is a pretty obscure case, and one we can't even begin to
support yet anyway.
