Either one has downsides.  Pointer to struct async_syscall requires that 
the caller keep the struct around.  Pointer to result requires that the 
caller always reserve a location for the result.
Does the kernel care about the (possibly rare) case of callers that 
don't want to pay attention to result?  If so, what about adding some 
kind of caller-specified handle to struct async_syscall, and having 
async_wait() return the handle?  In the case where the caller does care 
about the result, the handle could just be the address of result.
