Even if we accept a module that grants capabilities to groups this isn't fine
yet because it only supports two specific capabilities (and even those two in
different ways!) instead of adding generic support to bind capabilities to
groups.
More comments on the actual code:
+#include <linux/module.h>
+#include <linux/security.h>
+
+#define RT_LSM "Realtime LSM "		/* syslog module name prefix */
+#define RT_ERR "Realtime: "		/* syslog error message prefix */
+#include <linux/vermagic.h>
+MODULE_INFO(vermagic,VERMAGIC_STRING);
This doesn't belong into a module.
+#define MY_NAME __stringify(KBUILD_MODNAME)
Please use normal prefix.  A module shouldn't behave differently depending on
what name you compile it as.
