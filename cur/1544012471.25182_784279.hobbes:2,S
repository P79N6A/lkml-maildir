Thanks for the warning.
I have a couple of alternatives in mind, the most decent one at the
moment is having two metadatas (M1 and M2) for the each block, and
update M1 on the first write to the given block, M2 on the second, M1 on
the third, and so on.
So, if a block has written "A" and M1 holds crc("A"), and the user wants
to write "B" to the block, I would first write crc("B") in M2, and then
write "B" to the block.
The biggest problem I can see with this approach is that I require
either a timestamp on the metadata so I can determine where to write (if
M1 or M2).
And I'm not sure if it'd perform better than the journal, tho.
Do you have any suggestions as to how can I handle this issue?

Wouldn't that lead to confusion, because people can think the device
holds an ext3/4 external journal, while it actually holds a
device-mapper backing device that happens to contain a journal?
What would be the advantages of using the ext3/4 journal format, over a
simple initial sector and the journal following?
Thanks,
