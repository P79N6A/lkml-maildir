This will happen if you configure CONFIG_CPUSETS_LEGACY_API

This works now.

That works now.

Right now you can't have multiple independent hierarchies - each
subsystem either has the same hierarchy as all the other subsystems,
or has just a single node and doesn't participate in the hierarchy.

I don't know about group (4), but we certainly have a big need for (3).

I think it's better to treat resource groups as a common framework for
resource controllers, rather than a resource controller itself.
Otherwise we'll have the same issues of wanting to treat separate
resources in separate hierarchies - by treating each RG controller as
a separate entitiy sharing a common resource metaphor and user API,
you get the multiple hierarchy support for free.

Yes, that's the aproach that I'm thinking of currently. It should
require pretty reasonably robotic changes to the existing code.
One of the issues that crops up with it is what do you put in
/proc/<pid>/container if there are multiple hierarchies?
