With the IOPROC patch the device driver hooks are registered on a per process
or perhaps better still, a per VMA basis. And for processes/VMAs where there
are no registrations the overhead is very low.
With multiple cards in a box, all using different device drivers, I guess there
could end up being multiple registrations per process/VMA. But I'm not sure
this will be a common case for RDMA use in real life.
