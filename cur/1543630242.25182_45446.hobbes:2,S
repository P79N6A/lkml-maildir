The interesting thing is that, in this case, cpp HAS THE INFO to do the 
job, while it would be a bit of a hassel to round it up for sed.  I.e. the
endian macro is defined in the cpp build, not in macros naturally available
to make or sed.  At the same time any thing make knows can easily be push
into cpp via a command line macro.
