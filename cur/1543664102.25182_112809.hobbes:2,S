This clearly depends on the workload. For most vector processors
partitioning does not make sense. And dont forget, most of those systems are
pure compute servers used fr scientific computing.

The fastest Cray on top500.org is T3E1200 on rank _22_, the fastest IBM is
ranked _2_ with a Power3 PRocessor. There are 13 IBM systems before the
first (fastest) Cray system. Of course those GFlops are measured for
parallel problems, but there are a lot out there.
And all those numbers are totally uninteresting for DB or Storage Servers.
Even a SAP SD Benchmark would not be fun on a Cray.

thats clearly wrong.

There are a lot of Power3 ans Alpha systems before the first cray.
