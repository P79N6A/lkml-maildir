What I personally hate even more are help texts, that want me to say Y, 
but don't really explain why (and even worse are options which set the 
default to y without explanation).
This is a somewhat common boilerplate which has it's origin in the old 
config help files and has been copied everywhere. A good help text should 
explain what it does, when the option is enabled and then can give
specific advice, who should enable it.
bye, Roman
