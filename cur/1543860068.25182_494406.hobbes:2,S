Correct, mincore is only used to check if it should delay the hash checking.

The length of the chunks is only page aligned on single file torrents,
not so on multi-file torrents. I've attached a patch for rtorrent that
will extend the length to the page boundary.

This should be the case, but two mapped chunks may share a page,
sometimes with different r/w permissions.
