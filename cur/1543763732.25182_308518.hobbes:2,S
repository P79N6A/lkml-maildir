The livelock is observed with an in-house stress test suite.  The original
intent of that test is remotely connected to stress the kernel.  It is by
accident that it triggered a kernel issue.  Though, we are now worried that
this can be used as a DOS attack.

This sounds plausible, though my first try did not yield desired result
(i.e., still hangs the kernel, I might missed a few things here and there).
