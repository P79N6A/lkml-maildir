After making the change that Linus suggested, my mouse at least started
working.
When I looked at my system log, I noticed the keyboard seemed to be
locking
up around the time the gpm driver got loaded.  However, removing gpm
from my
system did not help.  I guess that confirms your theory that the
problems are 
at least not identical.  However, since most of these recent keyboard
lockup
problems started recently, it seems likely that there is some underlying
change
that was introduced which is manifesting differently depending on system
hardware.  At least, that's my theory.
