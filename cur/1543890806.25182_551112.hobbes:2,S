I think, as Linus pointed out (as I did a few months ago), that there's 
confusion about the term "Unification" or "Single Interface".
Unification is not about fetching all the data coming from the more 
diverse sources, into a single interface. That is just broken, because 
each data source wants a different data structure to be reported. 
This is ABI-hell 101. Unification is the ability to uniformly wait for 
readiness, and then fetch data with source-dependent collectors (read(2), 
io_getvents(2), ...). That way you have ABI isolation on the single 
data source, and not monster structures trying to blob together the more 
diverse data formats.
AFAIK, inotify works with select/poll/epoll as is.
