I don't think so.  The organisation of the VIVT caches in terms of
how the set index and tag correspond with virtual addresses are hardly
ever documented.  When they are, they don't appear to lend themselves
to such an approach.  For example,  Xscale has:
 tag:       virtual address b31-10
 set index: b9-5
and there's 32 ways per set.  So there's nothing to be gained from
controlling the virtual address which individual mappings end up at
in this case.
