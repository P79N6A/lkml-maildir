Ethernet.
Ethernet is much worse than any SCSI. Unlike SCSI it generates
irqs not after we asked it, but when something arrives with frequency
limited only by our capacities to handle them 8)

There is less elegant but more safe and information rich way to debug it
not waiting, when box will crash and crap hard disk. I just inserted sp checks
in irq handler and in net_bh, which evaluated and reported
stack record and halted cpu, when it was end of struct task+512 8)8)
You may repeat this doing 8)
