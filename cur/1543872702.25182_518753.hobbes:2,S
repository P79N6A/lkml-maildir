Just to comment, I've been running one of the patches between 20-ck1 and 
this latest one, which is building as I type, but I also run gkrellm 
here, version 2.2.9.
Since I have been running this middle of this series patch, something is 
killing gkrellm about once a day, and there is nothing in the logs to 
indicate a problem.  I see a blink out of the corner of my eye, and its 
gone.  And it always starts right back up from a kmenu click.
No idea if anyone else is experiencing this or not.
