I disagree.  Loopback filesystems typically have their data contiguously
on disk and won't split up incoming requests any further.
Here are the points I'm trying to address:
	- reduce the overhead in submitting block ios, especially for
	  large ios. Look at the %CPU usages differences between 512 byte
	  blocks and 4KB blocks, this can be better.
	- make asynchronous io possible in the block layer.  This is
	  impossible with the current ll_rw_block scheme and io request
	  plugging.
	- provide a generic mechanism for reordering io requests for
	  devices which will benefit from this.  Make it a library for
	  drivers to call into.  IDE for example will probably make use of
	  it, but some high end devices do this on the controller.  This
	  is the important point: Make it OPTIONAL.
You mentioned non-spindle base io devices in your last message.  Take
something like a big RAM disk.  Now compare kiobuf base io to buffer head
based io.  Tell me which one is going to perform better.
