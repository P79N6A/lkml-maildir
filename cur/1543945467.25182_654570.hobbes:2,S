The problem is that for at least one architecture, CONFIG_HZ is settable 
to arbitrary values, so you need a way to invoke the generic code if you 
don't have a pre-canned value available.
I have to admit to having very little interest in this kind of 
minimality exercises, which seem to have pretty much academic value only 
-- in reality, people cross-compile the kernel to go onto this kind of 
minimal boxes.
