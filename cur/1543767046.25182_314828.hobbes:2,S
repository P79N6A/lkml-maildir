What messages were displayed by e2fsck?  What version of the kernel
are you running?
No, I haven't heard of any such problems with ext2/3 filesystems.
This is the first time that someone was reported a specific problem
with the # of blocks used accounting.  There is the standard "file
held open so the number of blocks used is greater than blocks reported
by du", but that won't cause df to display negative numbers.
