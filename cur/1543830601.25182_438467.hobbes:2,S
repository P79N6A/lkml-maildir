hi
had a look again. this one on top of "kbuild: fix make -rR breakage" (ie. revert
the revert) should fix the module nameing.
Sam if you agree, please add your signed-off-by and forward to Linus.

[PATCH] kbuild: fix module names
commit e5c44fd88c146755da6941d047de4d97651404a9 (kbuild: fix make -rR breakage)
replaced the usage of the $(*F) variable with $(basetarget) which is defined as
	 basetarget = $(basename $(notdir $@))
to get the same, but without using the stem $(*F) because make not always
correctly supplys it. the problem are the module names which depend on the name
of 'foo.mod.o'. the original usage of the stem $(*F) gave 'foo' in this case, but
the new $(basetarget) does not. example from a
	make -p SUBDIRS=drivers/pcmcia modules
	drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia.mod.o: drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia.mod.c FORCE
	#  Implicit rule search has not been done.
	#  Implicit/static pattern stem: `drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia'
	#  Last modified 2006-06-28 16:00:14
	#  File has been updated.
	#  Successfully updated.
	# automatic
	# @ := drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia.mod.o
	# automatic
	# % :=
	# automatic
	# * := drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia
	[snip]
so the stem for 'drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia.mod.o' is just 'drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia' which
gives the correct module name. so to get back the "old" behaviour without using the
stem do an additional patsubst to get rid of the '.mod'
