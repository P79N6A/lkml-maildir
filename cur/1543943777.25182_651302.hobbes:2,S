Willy,
Just wondering...why don't we just pass "struct bus*" through to the
raw_pci* ops?
My thinking is if a PCI bus controller or bridge is discovered, then we should
always create a matching "struct bus *".
Your patch looks fine to me but if you (and others) agree with the above,
I can make patch to change the internal interface. The pci_*_config API
needs to remain the same.

Why are we using raw_pci_read here instead of pci_read_config_dword()?
If the pci_write_config_byte() above works, then I expect the read
to work too.
To be clear, this is not a problem with this patch...rather a seperate
problem with the original code.
hth,
