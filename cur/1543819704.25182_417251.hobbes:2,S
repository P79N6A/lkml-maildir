Benoit Garnier did point to me this thread: 
http://kerneltrap.org/node/5836
The solution proposed can't be applied to me because I have a dual
system where my HD is IDE/ATAPI and my DVD reader is S-ATA.
Indeed, I tried out several possibilities and it appeared that the way
to generate such errors was to set the Intel PIIX/ICH SATA support as
built-in (y). When set as module (m), everything is fine.
Device Drivers --->
  SCSI device support --->
    SCSI low-level drivers --->
      Intel PIIX/ICH SATA support
I might have changed this when hard-coding atapi_enabled=1 in the source.
Does someone see the light now ? (I'm still a bit in the dark)
Regards
