Nearly right. He will need to enter static ARP entries for this to
work because his host will try to resolve the gateway's address first,
so nothing except ARP will go out.
DNAT out + SNAT in may be OK. I've used this setup in the past, but didn't
not go on because of performance problems. Now, Julian Anastasov has written
a wonderful patch named "send-to-self" which does the trick automagically.
You can get it on his site ( 
http://www.ssi.bg/~ja/
 IIRC ).

Right. Except that in some very weird cases, the higher MTU on loopback may
affect the app's behaviour (less packets, or bigger reads at once, etc...).
Cheers,
