Hi all,
I'm not sure that this is a bug, but it's odd.
I installed the 2.2.7 kernel the morning of May 8 and it has been
running nicely on my Pentium laptop. This is a debian potato system.
I haven't touched the kernel since putting it in, but I have
updated some userland packages.
Today I booted and noticed that I didn't get the usual 300.65 bogomips
I'm used to seeing. My syslog entries report four different values
varying by up to 90 points! (I don't have log entries going back
to pre-2.2.7, but I don't remember seeing anything but 300.65 before.)
My BIOS is configured with APM support, but set never to slow the CPU.
Everything seems to work well whatever BogoMIPS count comes up.
The CPU Hz value also varies among several values but not widely
enough to cover the range of BogoMIPS (to my eyes).
Is there any interest in figuring this out or reason to suspect a
real problem? If so I will be glad to provide more data.
(Please cc: me on any responses as I am on digest.)
Cheers & Thanks,
   Dave
