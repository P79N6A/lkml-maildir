The PCI standard is quite explicit: byte accesses are permitted to the
data window (0xCFC) and not permitted to the address window (0xCF8).
Accepting byte accesses to the address window, or not supporting byte
accesses to the data window, *will* result in breakage (I can attest to
this fact quite well.)
