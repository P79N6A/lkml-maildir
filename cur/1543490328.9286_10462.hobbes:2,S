MP3 playing during FS reads work great, yes. But the
problem is that clustered readins also cause larger
amounts of FS writing on smaller machines, and that's
where things start to break down.
Another possible cause is that the mp3 player has to
free memory itself when it is already in need of new
data from disk...
