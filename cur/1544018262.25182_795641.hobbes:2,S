If you do gitk mm/memory.c, and look at the first 2 or 3 commits from
Hugh near the botto,, I -think- they may explain why you no longer see
the use of TASK_SIZE in there, ie, we may have fixed that in 2.6.12...
So from that point of view, it's quite possible that we no longer need
to defer the personality switch, which would allow to simplify things
quite a bit on ppc64, unless there is some -other- reason here...
Cheers,
Ben.
