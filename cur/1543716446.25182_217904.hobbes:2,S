Hi,
Just curious, what is one supposed to do for swap for diskless 
machines? Swap on NFS files refuses to work. Is swap on NBD possible 
(googling suggests patches were required - did these make it in to 
the kernel?). If not, is there any way at all to sanely do swap for 
diskless machines with 2.6?
regards,
