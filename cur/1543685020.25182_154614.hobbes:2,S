But symlinks work over NFS. You just have to make sure they are
relative to whatever the remote mount-point is:

As you an clearly see, the symlink to the directories worked
fine. You don't need a hard-link at all. I deliberately created
a broken link, deleted it, then made another that works.
Everything I did locally could have been done remotely on
the server who's /tmp directory I mounted R/W. All you
need to do to make such working links is to use the
same mount-point name on each of you clients. That way,
a sim-link will work the same for everybody.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
