Using a patch that fixes a number of people's nforce2
lockups while enabling io-apic edge timer, I can now
use nmi_watchdog=2 but not =1
turn on ioapic edge timer--
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/bart/2.6.0-test11-bart1/broken-out/nforce2-apic.patch
We're all trying to get acpi, apic, lapic, io-apic working
when turned on in cmos/bios and kernel.
The three things that each alone have achieved stability
on somebody's system here are 1) bios update 2) cpu
disconnect off either in cmos if available or by athcool
or kernel patch with same 3) timing delay patch
For CPU disconnect you still need athcool or this one
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/bart/2.6.0-test11-bart1/broken-out/nforce2-disconnect-quirk.patch
 
Both patches are for 2.6.0-test11 kernel.
