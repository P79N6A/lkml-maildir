The scale down isn't exactly on every address bits.  Top 3 bits of
virtual address are preserved.
#define htlbpage_to_page(x)    (((unsigned long) REGION_NUMBER(x) << 61)
                                 | (REGION_OFFSET(x) >>
(HPAGE_SHIFT-PAGE_SHIFT)))
So scaled address for a hugetlb address will never be below unscaled
normal page address.  That is adjusted addr will never below unchanged
floor.
