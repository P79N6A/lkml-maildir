	Could you please send this directly to me. I hate scrubbing
large patches from the mailing list archive.
	Note that before even thinking of pushing this patch in the
kernel, we need to perform testing with the hardware on i386 and
potentially on ARM. The author only tried with irtty that doesn't use
this function, so that's not a valid test at all. Finding people test
those changes is going to be tough, as usual.
	I'm also wondering about the validity of those changes, but
that's another matter I need to go through. During 2.5.X, some people
assured me that using isa_virt_to_bus was safe on all platform with an
ISA bus...
	Thanks...
	Jean
