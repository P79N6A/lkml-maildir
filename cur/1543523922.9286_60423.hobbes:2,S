Yes, it does.
Now 0x17 is a Class A address, right?
Given a subneting with a netmask of 24 bits (as in his example) you would get
8 bit for network number (from the Class A), 16 bits for subnet number
(netmask - 8 = 16) and the last 8 bits come from the netmask (32 - netmask).
Those, you end up with the numbers above.
Please enligthen me if you can find an error in my reasoning, all under the
assumption of an non-CIDR case.
Cheers,
Magnus
