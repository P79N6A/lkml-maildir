Hello!
I'm using linux-2.4.19pre1 on x86/SMP and I believe I found a bug in the 
sk98lin driver.
It shows by unloading and loading the module sk98lin - then one more directory 
entry "/proc/net/sk98lin" is created. I tested this with up to 4 directories.
I think this is a bug in the unregister function of your driver.
Thank you for your patience.
Regards,
Ph. Marek
