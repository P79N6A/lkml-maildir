That's output.  It's easier to do the conversion with output.  And I guess
one could argue that lots of people read /proc files, but few write to
them.
Generally I don't think we should be teaching the kernel to accept
pretend-floating-point numbers like this, especially when a) "delay in
milliseconds" is such a simple concept and b) it's so easy to go from float
to milliseconds in userspace.
Do you really expect that humans (really dumb ones ;)) will be echoing
numbers into this file?  Or will it mainly be a thing for mdadm to fiddle
with?
