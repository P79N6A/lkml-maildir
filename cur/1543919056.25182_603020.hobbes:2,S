Hrm... jejb made a remark that it might be better to pass the
scsi_host's device into request_firmware() as your example does, so I'll
pitch in a patch to do likewise with libsas--the scsi_host knows the
actual device it's coming from, and userland can sort that all out later
anyway via DEVPATH.
I suppose one could also have multiple scsi_hosts per PCI device, which
means that my first patch would stumble horribly in more than a few
cases.

That's ok, I don't do FC. :)  Looks mostly good to me...
