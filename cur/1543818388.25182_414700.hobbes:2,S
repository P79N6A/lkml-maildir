Sorry, I thought when you said top-post, I thought you were telling me about only posting the "top" most errors in my original e-mail, thats why i pasted full error output.
The thing is, it compiles successfully when CONFIG_NET_SCHED is not enabled in the kernel.  But when its not enabled, i get the external symbol errors.
As soon as I enable CONFIG_NET_SCHED ... it no longer compiles.
I will look into this, it is supposed to work... the code has been used by others before.
If you or anyone else come up with anything, please let me know
Thanks!
George
