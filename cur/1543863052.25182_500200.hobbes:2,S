Not for me.
I'm still have the same trouble, but less (maybe about every hour, instead of 
every 5 minutes). futhermore, I found a patch
cocktail-2.6.20-rc3.patch: 
http://tinyurl.com/2gza8q,
 which improves the 
situation too! 
Now, the funny thing is that I've two SATA HDDs, but only 1 causes all the
headaches.
The affected drive is a:
sda - @ata3.0 - WDC WD2500KS-00M 02.0
ATA-7, max UDMA/133, 488395055 sectors: LBA48
"ata3.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2 frozen
ata3.00: cmd ea/00:00:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/a0 tag 0 cdb 0x0 data 0 out
         res 40/00:ff:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/00 Emask 0x4 (timeout)

sda: Write Protect is off

the "good" HDD is a:
sdb - @ata4.0 - WDC WD2500YD-01N 10.0
ATA-7, max UDMA/133, 490234752 sectors: LBA48 NCQ (depth 0/1)
