there are noticeable accounting artifacts on fast boxes that do 
sub-microsecond scheduling, so getting the best sched_clock() resolution 
is certainly handy. (Also, nanoseconds gives us some rounding-error 
room.) But 0.125 usecs should still be fine.
the 2 years overflow is not an issue: you could solve that by only using 
the first 55 bits of the clock. This means the clock would wrap around 
every 1.14 years - the effects of that are that the "dont let time go 
backwards" code in the scheduler will ignore a very small interval 
(which happens at the wraparound) and will continue with the 
wrapped-around clock from that point on. The rq->clock itself is a true, 
monotonic 64-bit clock that wraps every 584.9 years.
[ and even after 584.9 years it should have no serious failure mode, as 
  the timestamps are used in a relative manner. The only, minimal effect 
  is on tasks that sleep for more than 584 years - which could get a few 
  millisecs less sleeper fairness share. I am not overly worried about
  getting bugreports about that in my lifetime though =B-) (unless
  someone gets serious about bio-cryogenics R&D, real soon.) ]
