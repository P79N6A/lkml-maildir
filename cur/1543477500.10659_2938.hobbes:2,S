Oh OK I didn't follow it that close.

The only second other "feature" bit tested there I see which can't be
avoided is the distinguishment between slabs for slabs and slabs for
other things. Many many of the other features are dead as well :-).

So put the whole back into 2.3.x.

This is mainly prooving that the slab is a faster kmalloc in some places
:-).
It doesn't exclude the possibility to make it even faster and cleaner
in implementation :-).
However I have evidently my oppinnions about the usefulness of the
constructor/destructor concept in respect of the current *fundamental*
kernel design. The colouring benchmarks I don't beleve until I 
reproduce them myself in a NON ISOLATED environment.

Eh... David just a hint: I'm not that "durny i naiwny" to claim that I
would
like to start from scratch and provide something entiertly new and
"wonderfull".
Really no need to get ironic... (however please feel free at ironizing
at
my english as much as is deservs :-)
I already quite like for example the idea of saving passing the structs
size
all the way along it's allocation for example!. This way the unavoidable
second parameter is servig a dual purspose instead of a single one. It
hints 
us at where to get our allocation chunk candidates from as well.
I would just like do some deeper cleanup in the existing slab.c
Please take note of the comments about the additional flags usage for 
kmem_create_cache I have put in the patch too. OK?
