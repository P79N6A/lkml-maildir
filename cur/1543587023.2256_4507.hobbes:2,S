You need to use diagnostic or setup utility of that specific device, the
utility usually comes with the specific driver using the driver to receive
info about mii registers (the registers in charge of full/half 10/100 etc').
you can find many drivers and diagnostic utilities at

Subject: ethernet phy link state info
Hi all,
where do I find information about the current link state of the ethernet PHY
(e.g. 100mbit/s full duplex) ?
Something like /proc/sys/net/* ?
Thanks
Bernhard
