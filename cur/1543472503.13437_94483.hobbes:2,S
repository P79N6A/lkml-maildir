One way around is to make a proc entry for you card, and then use 
ioctl to pass the firmware to the drive. This way before the cards becomes 
working a special program should upload firmware to the card (using this
ioctl).
The other way is as you suggested, create a module which exports one
function that returns the pointer to your firmware. You call it, get the
pointer, upload firmware and then unload the module. You would have to
tell the kernel that you don't need the second module after you uploaded
the firmware, otherwise it will think that the first module is still using
it.
