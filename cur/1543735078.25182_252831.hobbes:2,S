BTW, so far the most frequent class of endianness bugs had been along the
lines of
	foo->le16_field = cpu_to_le32(12);
and vice versa.  On big-endian it's a guaranteed FUBAR - think carefully about
the value that will end up there.

We probably want __attribute__((opaque)) in addition to bitwise - e.g. for
the handles of all sorts passed in network filesystem protocols.  I'll look
into that when we get the endianness warnings somewhat under control.
For now I'm going to #define __opaque __bitwise and use it for stuff like
	typedef __u32 __opaque cifs_fid;
etc.
