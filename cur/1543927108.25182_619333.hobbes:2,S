Ah, I see the problem.  It would in fact be clearer for us to move 
boot_cpu_init() up to just after smp_setup_processor_id() in start_kernel 
anyway, not just for this code, but in general.

I think it's still a win, though worth a comment that we always go via the 
non-IPI path for the early boot case.
