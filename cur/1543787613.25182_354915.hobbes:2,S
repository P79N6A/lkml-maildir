So submit patches to fix it!  You clearly understand what is wrong,  
so why not help change it?

WRONG.  This is not the way Linux works.  We break internal APIs all  
the time.  If you need to change one _thats_OK_.  Userspace ABI is  
mostly another matter, but that's different from the internal data  
structures and functions.

Except this introduces bloat and multiplies maintainer load.  Fix the  
existing one.  If it breaks other in-core drivers, fix those to  
match.  If it breaks out-of-tree drivers, too bad!  They should get  
their code upstream and then they wouldn't need to worry.

This is not the way Linux works.  It may be the way Adaptec works,  
but that's not relevant here.
