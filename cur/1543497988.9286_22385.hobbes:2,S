Forgive me, but these seem like trivial complaints.  The purpose of the
OS is not to support OS hackers.  Do insmod by hand from
/usr/src/mylinux/modules and you'll be fine.

So why shouldn't the kernel+init be able to load modules for you?
It seems to me that the real problem is a clumsy interaction between kernel
and modules. What one should be able to do is to provide initrd a method
for loading modules _before_ the root file device is enabled. And this method
needs to be easily configurable at compile and boot time.
