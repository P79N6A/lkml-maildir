PCI Bus resets?
That means linux kernel needs to reconfigure everything unless
the BIOS gets invoked again (machine reset). Linux has *most*
of the code to do this but I'm pretty sure enough existing
configs won't work that this will be very painful.

Sure there is. Every IRQ line goes to an IRQ controller.
Arch specific code deals with programming the controller and can
mask all interrupts (or not). Historically, they've been left unmasked
for ISA IRQ discovery and debugging misrouted IRQ lines.

Exactly. That's really the main problem with disabling DMA globally.
I don't have any brilliant ideas on how to fix this either
except shutdown console before PCI bus walks and switch to 
linux console after PCI bus walks. Makes debugging PCI issues
a bit more difficult though.
