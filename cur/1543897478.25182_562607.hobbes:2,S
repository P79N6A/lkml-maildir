[ I have a sinking feeling Gmail mangled the patch yet again. So,
resending. And I'm getting myself a decent mailer ASAP. Sorry for

is because kernel/kthread.c:kthreadd() is not __init but calls
kthreadd_setup() which is __init. But this is ok, because kthreadd_setup()
is only ever called at init time, and then kthreadd() proceeds into its
"for (;;)" loop.
We could mark kthreadd() __init_refok, but I feel kthreadd_setup() with
just one call site and 4 lines in it shouldn't be a separate function at
all. So let's lose it and code it explicitly in kthreadd() itself.
