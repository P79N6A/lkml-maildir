ordering... write combining would be fine.

Hmm... I've seen ppc64 do some pretty freaky reordering but on the
other hand that's a 64-bit arch so we don't care in this case.  I
guess I'd rather keep the barrier there so we don't have the
possibility of a rare hardware crash when the HCA just happens to read
the doorbell record in a corrupt state.
