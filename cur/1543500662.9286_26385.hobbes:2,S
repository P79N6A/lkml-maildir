in my patch even holes are BH_Mapped, thats the difference. I think these
are the correct state bits:
block mapping state:
        b_blocknr: on-disk location of the block
	BH_Hole: shortcut 'special' mapping, all zeros. [we could have
                 other special mappings as well.]
	BH_Mapped: does (b_blocknr, BH_Hole) represent the
                   logical->physical mapping between inode block and
                   physical block. [we keep unmapped bhs around for
                   partial writes]
_iff_ a mapping is established, the following bits describe the data
block caching state:
data cache state bits:
        BH_Uptodate: is in-memory content 'younger' than on-disk content.
                     [can be equal]
        BH_Dirty: is in-memory data is strictly younger.
        BH_New: on-disk data is invalid.
[these three would be slightly redundant if they represented an eg. CPU
cache, but an IO cache also has to deal with error handling.]
So i think there is _no_ real relation between BH_Mapped and the caching
state bits, apart from the fact that currently we first establish the
mapping and then start off with !BH_Uptodate !Dirty. 
(the use of these bits might be currently used inconsistenty in a few
places, but this was the thinking behind it.)
_currently_ i agree that we might encode BH_Hole as an otherwise invalid
combination of state-bits, but i think this is dangerous. Eg. if we want
to do the 'delayed write' stuff [to allocate on-disk blocks only when a
block is being written out], then (Uptodate && !Mapped) will be a valid
combination: it means that the mapping towards the disk (filesystem) is
not yet established, but in-memory contents are valid and (obviously) more
recent than on-disk contents.

i agree that exporting it into the VM space is much ado for nothing. 
Doing it in the buffer-cache layer is rather cheap though. [and we already
do it]
