You might be able to adapt/add to Richard's code that probes CIA/PYXIS
to determine if workarounds (for other things :-) are needed.

Correct; if you put the problematic card/driver behind the bridge on
MIATA (ie one of the 32-bit slots), the problems go away. No such luck
on LX/SX, but they may have HW workarounds already implemented.

"Identification" may need to be done via "probe and see"... :-\
IIRC, there was only ever one rev of PYXIS, which has a number of
problems.
The first MIATAs went out with (nearly) no fixes, except for the
console cruft to prevent "unknown" cards from being placed in the
64-bit slots (unkown cards == unknown drivers == possibly susceptible
to the 8K boundary DMA error).
LX and SX introduced off-chip PYXIS fixes, which fixed at least the
8K boundary DMA problem, and some others, but NOT all, most notably
the PCI READ prefetch.
Late MIATAs, aka MIATA-GL, have off-chip logic that fix ALL the PYXIS
problems, AFAIK. These are distinguished from the earlier model by the
presence of a QLogic ISP-1040C(?) SCSI chip built into the motherboard.
