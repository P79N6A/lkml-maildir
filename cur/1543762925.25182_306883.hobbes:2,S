this behavior is intentional: 'forced preemption' (of any sort, even in 
the upstream kernel's CONFIG_PREEMPT model) should not impact the task's 
state. So it does not modify p->state. [ The TASK_RUNNING_MUTEX state 
furthermore enables wakeups to occur in an invariant way: even though 
technically the tasks are on the runqueue, a 'normal' wakeup is still 
noticed and later on acted upon.]
this is very important for forced preemption to not impact the coding 
model of kernel code that is normally tested with !PREEMPT. (the 
TASK_RUNNING_MUTEX scheduler feature furthermore enables us to preempt 
without impacting wakeup logic.)

it is not a problem to have tasks with TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE on the 
runqueue - this happens every day with CONFIG_PREEMPT kernels, and it's 
fully intentional. Can you see any bugs caused by this behavior?
