I can't think of any. The interrupts are occurring
and being serviced. Nothing else seems to be sitting
on that interrupt. It's reaching a bit: maybe there
is some console output interfering with the
file transfer protocol, but it only occurs with
interrupt enabled because of some initial timing?
(polling mode may delay things enough to work)
What protocol is ckermit using? (zmodem, etc)
