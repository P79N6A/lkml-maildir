I discussed this a bit with David.  My personal feelings are that I 
prefer just leaving all the printk's as they are.  But Linus and GregKH 
have been accepting patches into other parts of the tree like this one, 
and logging additional already-computer-parsed information is probably 
not a bad thing long-term, so perhaps I've been being a bit of a Luddite 
on this issue.
It's definitely too late for 2.6.0-testX mainline merging, until Andrew 
(2.6) and Linus (2.7) re-open their respective trees, but a good first 
step would be for me to merge this into the net-drivers-2.5-exp queue.
