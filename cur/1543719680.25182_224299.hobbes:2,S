Ok, this qualifies as bug fixing or close enough.;-)

V4 performance is not at a stable point at the moment I think, I have 
not been monitoring things closely due to trying to earn bucks 
consulting, and performance did not get tested every week, but there 
have been reports of performance decreasing and no reports of anyone 
investigating it, so I need to....
Elena, please compose a URL consisting of past benchmarks of various V4 
snapshots and send it to me.  (I did not read the last one you sent, 
sorry about that, so include the contents of that one also).
If the objective is to determine if the algorithm is good, then we 
should test it with only the algorithm in question changed.
I would be quite happy to add the algorithm to V4 (or Chris and Jeff can 
do that) and test it on vs. off.
Zam, place that on your todo list and send the todo list to me....
