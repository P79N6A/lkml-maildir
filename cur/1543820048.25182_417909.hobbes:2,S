Sorry, I thought I'd bounced this one patch in the series to the audit list.
I meant to. One more thing lost in the noise.  Apologies.
1500 should already be reserved for apparmor userside.  Only change is to 
enable it kernelside plus of course the one more symbol export to bloat the 
kernel image.  Export of the vformat call is to make it analagous to vprintk.  
Sometimes it's more convenient to have a single point of logging (as we do)
and you need to log data which is in va_list format.
