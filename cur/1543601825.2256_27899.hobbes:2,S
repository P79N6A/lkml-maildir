actually one feature of the 10pre11 VM is that it will avoid a task to
give to other people the pages that it is freeing for itself. The
previous VM didn't has such a feature. So (in theory :) it should be the
other way around. see the implementation of page_alloc.c::balance_classzone().
Actually Linus found just a few minutes ago a possible source for high
latencies in the pre12 VM, my silly mistake, he will certainly fix it in
pre13 somehow just in case that was the problem.
