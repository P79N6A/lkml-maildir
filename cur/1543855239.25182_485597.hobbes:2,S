Interesting idea, indeed. We'll implement this in our reference UI
(which currently is just a bunch of shell scripts) so we can test the
feasibility of this approach. Additionally, I think it's a good idea
to investigate how other vendors currently support password protection
on their products (for now I've just seen Nokia cellphones with such
support, maybe PDAs or other mobile devices support this?), so we can
have compatible policies, allowing to lock/unlock cards across
devices.
Anyway, I also agree this is out of scope of the kernel support, but
still it's very important for a complete support.
