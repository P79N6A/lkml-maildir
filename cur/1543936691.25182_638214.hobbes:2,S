Oops, sorry, missed this the first time.
Actually that was a note from someone else and I didn't address it. 
(Weirdly, I had removed it but some quilt refresh demon brought it back. ;-)
We found this error in testing with a virtual BIOS but I think we
never figured out if it was an error in our BIOS or a valid error. 
But in any case, I'll fix it.
Thanks,
Mike
