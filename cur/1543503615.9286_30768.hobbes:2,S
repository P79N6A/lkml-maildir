Note that those errors are NOT bash errors, but errors from the
separate test program that you're calling.
That also leads to the obvious question: Why use an external test
program when bash has a faster one built in to it? Here's the above
script, with a common tweak to enable it to process the larger numbers
faster, and written to use bash's internal test command instead...
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
#!/bin/bash
printf %5d 2
declare -i i=3 j k=1 l
while [ $i -lt 10000 ]; do
    j=3
    l=`echo 2k$i v0.5+p | dc | cut -d . -f 1`
    while [ $j -le $l ]; do
	if [ $[$i%$j] -eq 0 ]; then
	    break
	fi
	j=$j+2
    done
    if [ $j -gt $l ]; then
	printf %5d $i
	k=$k+1
	if [ $k -eq 15 ]; then
	    echo
	    k=0
	fi
    fi
    i=$i+2
done
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
This version prints out the results much faster than yours does.
Incidentally, the 'tweak' referred to above is to recognise that any
number can only have a divisor greater than its square root if it also
has one smaller than its square root, so the inner loop only tests up
to and including the odd number nearest to the square root.
As an example of the speedup involved, when it's checking 9973 for
primality, it only needs to check for divisibility by one of 50
numbers to determine that, rather than checking for divisibility by
one of 4,986 numbers.
Incidentally, it determines that 9973 is prime.
Also, a second speedup is gained by moving the printing test outside
of the inner loop, and a third by declaring all numeric variables to
be numeric.

This looks like a faulty test command to me - certainly, I was unable
to get the script to fail...

Not sure what the problem is, but it's neither a kernel one nor a bash
one...
