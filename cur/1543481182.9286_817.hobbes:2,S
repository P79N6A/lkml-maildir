I downloaded kernel 2.1.132 to have support for the SoundBlaster PCI128.
I got the soundcard working, but the PPP does not work.
The only difference I notice with the previous kernel I had (2.0.34) is that
the ppp version has changed ( 2.0.34 came with ppp2.2.0 and 2.1.132 with 
ppp2.3.? ).
THe pppd sends confReq packet and the ISP sends back a confRej. This happens
for some time and pppd gives up atlast.
Have anyone else noticed the same problem. Is there a patch for this.
Or is it a version mismatch between the ISP and my machine at home.
If so, is it possible to have the new kernel with the old version of PPP
and how. 
Thanks,
-)Bala.
