By far the easiest solution is to use ordinary Linux on a really old,
cheap PC, or a PC-on-a-board.
eCos can be built with the smallest memory and resource footprint of
any of the other techniques, but may not already support the Ethernet
cards or other devices you need: eCos just doesn't have the sheer
number of device drivers as does Linux.
uCLinux would work well enough, as it's intended for cheap-as-dirt
CPU's that lack an MMU. The features it lacks (there is no "fork()"
only "vfork()") can be easily worked around but your application
software may need tweaking.
Without knowing your engineering requirements it is impossible to say
what you need.
