I don't see any reason to introduce a second flag to say when a flag
has been set .. Initial reports are that symptoms go away when
    current->flags |= PF_MEMALLOC;
is set in the process about to do networking (and unset afterwards).
There will be more news later today. I believe that this will remove
deadlock against VM for tcp buffers, but I don't believe it will 
stop deadlocks against "nothing", when we simply are out of buffers.
The only thing that can do that is reserved memory for the socket.
Any pointers?
