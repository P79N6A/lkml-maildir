And your point is?  If you don't use it, you get exact same complexity
in both setups.

Sigh...  So put the binding into fstab and be done with that.

Right now the main objection is about your lack of ability to read.  Which
part of "it can be mounted in different chroots/namespaces, therefore
having absolute paths doesn't work" is too hard to understand?
No, it's not about having a default.  It's about keeping an absolute pathname
in virtual fs, having all instances autosoddingmatically sharing it _and_
having change attempt in any instance automatically affect all of them.
If you have that kind of sharing, don't pretend that your mechanism really
allows absolute pathnames.
