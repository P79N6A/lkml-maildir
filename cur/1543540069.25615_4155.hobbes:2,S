There is one very good reason for putting the bzImage in /boot, 
older BIOS:es have trouble with cylinders >1024 so I've almost
always but /boot on its own partition below 1024 cylinders and
have made it as small as possible, so even putting System.map 
there is a mistake really, so I'd rather se System.map in
/lib/modules/`uname -r`.
