Oh dear, would you believe I totally missed this entry in a dozen runs

Are we talking CONFIG_PATA_MARVELL here?  If so then the kernel I just
booted has this set to "y" (ie: built-in) and yet the drive is still not
detected.  Is there a newer version of this driver somewhere?  The kernel
was 2.6.22-rc2.
