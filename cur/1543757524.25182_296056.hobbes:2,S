I don't know anything about darcs, I was only talking about arch. I
failed to compile darcs after trying for a while, so I give it up, I'll
try again eventually.
But anyway the only thing I care about is that you import all dozen
thousands changesets of the 2.5 kernel into it, and you show it's
manageable with <1G of ram and that the backup size is not very far from
the 75M of CVS.
I read in the webpage of the darcs kernel repository that they had to
add RAM serveral times to avoid running out of memory. They needed more
than 1G IIRC, and that was enough for me to lose interest into it.
You're right I blamed the functional approach and so I felt it was going
to be a mess to fix the ram utilization, but as someone else pointed
out, perhaps it's darcs to blame and not haskell. I don't know.
To me backup size matters too and for example I'm quite happy the fsfs
backend of SVN generates very small backups compared to bsddb.

It is saved in a compact format, and I don't think it'll run slower
since if it's in cache it'll be fast and if it's I/O dominaed the more
compact it is, the faster it will be, having a compact size both for the
repository and for the backup, is more important to me.
In theory one could write a backup tool that extracts the thing and
rewrite a special backup-backend that is as space efficient as CVS and
that can compress as well as CVS, but this won't help the working copy.

This is already available with arch. Infact I suggested myself how to
improve it with hardlinks so that a checkout will take a few seconds no
matter the size of the tree.

If you use arch/darcs as a patch-download tool, then that's fine as you
say and you can already do that with arch (that in this part seems
already a lot more advanced and it's written in C btw).  Most people
just checking out the kernel with arch (or darcs) would never need to
download 600Megs of changes, but I need to download them all.
The major reason a versioning system is useful to me is to track all
changesets that touched a single file since the start of 2.5 to the
head. So I can't get away by downloading the last dozen patches and
caching the previous tree (which is perfectly doable with arch for ages
and with hardlinks as well).

The way RCS stores the stuff compresses great. In that is "magical". I
guess SCCS is the same. fsfs isn't bad either though, and infact I'd
never use bsddb and I'd only use fsfs with SVN.

What is the above 600/700 number then? I thought that was the conversion
of all dozen thousand changesets of linux-2.5 CVS to darcs.

I'll stay tuned.
To me the only argument for not using a "magic" format like CVS or SCCS
that is space efficient and compresses efficiently, is if you claim it's
going to be a lot slower at checkouts (but infact applying some dozen
thousand patchsets to run a checkout is going to be slower than
CVS/SCCS). I know it's so much simpler to keep each patchset in a
different file like arch is already doing, but that's not the best
on-disk format IMHO.
Note that some year ago I had the opposite idea, i.e. at some point I
got convinced it was so much better to keep each patch separated from
each other like you're advocating above, until I figured out how big the
thing grows and how little space efficient it is, and how much I/O it
forces me to do, how much disk it wastes in the backup and how slow it
is as well to checkout dozen thousand patchsets.
For smaller projects without dozen thousand changesets, the patch per
file looks fine instead. For big projects IMHO being space efficient is
much more important.
