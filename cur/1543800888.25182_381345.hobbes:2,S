this piece of code in __alloc_pages():
         if (((p->flags & PF_MEMALLOC) || 
unlikely(test_thread_flag(TIF_MEMDIE)))
                         && !in_interrupt()) {
                 if (!(gfp_mask & __GFP_NOMEMALLOC)) {
nofail_alloc:
                         /* go through the zonelist yet again, ignoring 
mins */
                         page = get_page_from_freelist(gfp_mask, order,
                                 zonelist, 
ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS|ALLOC_CPUSET);
ALLOC_CPUSET is specified, gfp_mask can be GFP_ATOMIC still and no 
__GFP_HARDWALL. Am I wrong?
