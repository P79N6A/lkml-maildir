Any ideas how to tell which Rev you have? I've had 2 people send me in
nearly identical MPS 1.1 vs MPS 1.4 results. Since I haven't been able
to tell people how to figure out the rev I haven't been able to gather
that info. *But* there is only one mainboard BIOS for the BP6 (Rev LP)
so that isn't the issue... the multiple BIOS available at www.bp6.com
just have different HPT366 BIOS tacked on to the LP mainboard BIOS.
