OK.  I guess I'm convinced then.  However, your patch description
needs to be a lot better.  It should describe things like why you
want to make the change and why the change you are proposing is a good
idea and is better than other alternatives.  If you'd done that
originally we might not have needed to have all this discussion. :)
Paul.
