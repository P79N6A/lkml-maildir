The system seemed to be stable for a few days, but then the following
happened:
- First I got read-only filesystem messages
- a few seconds later I/O errors
- After rebooting, the root filesystem (ext3) could not be mounted
- After fscking and a lot of deleted inodes, large portions of the
filesystem were gone to lost+found (/etc, /bin, ...)
I can only relate this to the driver, it seems very unstable :(
Some info: 2.4.20-ac2, asus a7v8x motherboard (onboard promise raid not
used), iwill IS150-R raid controler, 2 Maxtor 6Y080M0 SATA disks in
raid1.
