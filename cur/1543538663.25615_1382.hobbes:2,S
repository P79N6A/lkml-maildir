It's somewhat unfortunate, but it's not that big of a deal.  To
summarize, you can find the appropriate partition with looking at the
start field of HDIO_GETGEO; use /proc/partitions if you need to
actively look through the list of partitions for that device.
Yes, it's a bit hacky, but so is touching the mounted filesystem at
all.
In the 2.5 series we should fix this, though.
