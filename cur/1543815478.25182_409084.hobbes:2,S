Sorry for the troubles. I didn't noticed anything here indicating
troubles, otherwise I would never asked you to pull it.

I'm using stgit. It allows me to export the patches from V4L/DVB
Mercurial tree, removing backward compatible code and correcting the
patches. Is it broken?
Maybe I'm using a bad procedure to keep my -git tree.
My current procedure is:
branch origin - Your tree replica
branch work - my stgit main tree
branch work-fixes - my stgit tree for bug fixes
branch master - patches to current kernel
branch devel - patches to next kernel
All patches are generated against work branch, with stgit.
Branch work-fixes receives patches by using:
	stg pick <sha>@work
Before commiting to kernel.org, I do:
at origin:
	git pull linus_tree
at master:
	git pull . origin
	git pull . work-fixes
at devel:
	git pull . origin
	git pull . work

I'll retrieve from your tree and I'll do a double check if something
were misapplied.
