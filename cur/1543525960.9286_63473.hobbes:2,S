Hi!
My 3C589 Ethernet card (PCMCIA) doesn't work on my notebook since
2.3.42. In 2.3.43 it didn't compile and in 2.3.44 and above (up to 
2.3.46pre2) I get the following messages (lots of them):
Feb 15 16:21:37 antenas kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Feb 15 16:21:37 antenas kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out!
Feb 15 16:21:37 antenas kernel:   irq status 2000, rx status 8000, tx status 00  tx free 0bfc
Feb 15 16:21:37 antenas kernel:   diagnostics: fifo 0011 net 0c84 ethernet 0002 media a8c0
Of course, this problem leaves me without access to the network.
I thought it was a good idea to report the problem since I haven't
seen anything like this in linux-kernel.
My machine is available for testing...
Cheers,
peloy.-
