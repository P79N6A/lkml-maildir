Ummm... well, we have been making improvements.  I had already made fixes for
most of the problems you found, but you have some additional suggestions that
I have incorporated.  Here's my latest version (final-2):
**** DRAFT **** PRESS RELEASE - LINUX KERNEL 2.2.0 **** DRAFT ****
**** FORK 1 **** FINAL-2 DRAFT
Linux kernel version 2.2.0 released
FOR RELEASE: Tuesday 26 January 1999
Contact: linux-2.2@linuxunited.org
SANTA CLARA, C.A. -- Today Linus Torvalds, the primary developer and
coordinator of the Linux kernel team, released a major new version of the
Linux kernel. This update brings substantial performance improvements and a
multitude of new features.
Highlights include:
* Advanced network routing and wide area network (WAN) support give Linux the
  ability to replace many expensive, proprietary protocol network devices.
  Users can take control of their intranets with wide support for a wide
  variety of protocols, usage limits, accounting, and virtual private
  networks. Strong (256-bit) encryption is available as an add-on component.
* Owing to its tradition of open and international development, Linux is
  positioned as an operating system ready for the new millennium.  Linux 2.2
  is Y2K ready and continues to build on previous versions'
  internationalization.
* The network file system support is enterprise-grade, with data replication
  for performance, mobility, and reliability.
* New multimedia capabilities include video capture support, TV tuner
  support, and enhanced audio support.
* A wide variety of new SCSI and parallel port devices are now supported,
  including disk drives, tape drives, and other external devices.
* Linux's already legendary performance is significantly enhanced. High end
  symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support scales well, supporting systems
  with up to 64 processors.
* Compatibility with Windows NT and Unix filesystems enables Linux 2.2 to
  seamlessly handle data from legacy systems.  SAMBA (
http://www.samba.org/
)
  gives a Linux system the ability to provide a complete replacement for NT
  Server services, including file and print sharing and domain
  authentication.
* Because Linux operates under an open development model, any user has the
  ability to modify the operating system components and submit patches to
  the official distribution. This both facilitates the development of new
  features and enables users to repair problems within hours after they have
  been located.
Linux 2.2 is available for free download on the Internet: visit the Linux
Kernel Archive (
http://www.kernel.org/
) to obtain it from a worldwide
network of mirror servers which has been established in anticipation of
massive demand for this new version.  As always, the Linux kernel is
distributed as Free Software under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (
http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html
).
Linux distribution vendors are expected to ship fully-integrated systems
using the new kernel before Q2 1999.  Business users should look to their
distribution vendors for information about this important upgrade.
ABOUT LINUX
"Linux" is the common name for a class of secure network operating system
distributions based on the Linux kernel and software from the Free Software
Foundation's GNU Project.  Linux takes full advantage of modern, high-end
PC, Power Mac, Alpha, and UltraSPARC hardware. It can also breathe life
into older machines -- even 386- and 486-based computers. Networks of Linux
computers can provide supercomputer-like performance for some applications;
one widely-known example is the dramatic 3-D scenes in the blockbuster
movie "Titanic", which were rendered on Alpha-powered Linux systems.
Support is widely available both from distribution vendors and third
parties, as well as from numerous Usenet groups and mailing lists. Linux is
provided under an unlimited-use license that lets users make in-house
customizations to the system itself. Recent estimates suggest that Linux
has up to 20 million users worldwide.
Microsoft employees Josh Cohen and Vinod Valloppillil, in a competitive
examination of Linux (The so-called "Halloween Document",
http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html
), wrote that "Linux represents a
best-of-breed UNIX, that is trusted on mission critical applications, and -
due to its open source code - has a long term credibility which exceeds
many other competitive operating systems."
ABOUT LINUS TORVALDS
Linus Torvalds, originally from Finland, lives with his family in Santa
Clara, CA, USA. He and others created Linux as an open-source alternative
to proprietary, closed operating systems after becoming disillusioned with
the poor quality and prohibitive pricing of commercial offerings.
Linux is a trademark of Linus Torvalds. Power Mac is a trademark of Apple
Computer, Inc. UltraSPARC is a trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. Alpha is
a trademark of Compaq Computer Corporation. UNIX is a trademark of The Open
Group. Microsoft is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation.  All other
