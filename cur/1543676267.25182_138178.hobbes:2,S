Hi Marco,
thanks for your post - yes, we definitely need to be able to
compile with gcc-3.3.  Since it looks like you're a newcomer,
here are a few tips:
When you post changes like this,
please mention which version of the kernel source you're starting from.
Also, the preferred format for posting
changes like this is as an inline patch; see
http://www.tux.org/lkml/#s1-10
http://www.tux.org/lkml/#s4-1
http://www.kegel.com/academy/opensource.html#patches
Finally, check a recent version of the kernel before posting a patch.
It looks like this issue has been fixed in 2.5; see
http://lxr.linux.no/source/arch/i386/math-emu/poly.h?v=2.5.56
You might want to check 2.4.21-pre6 to see if it's been
fixed there yet, and if not, submit a patch to Marcello,
preferably using the same approach used in the 2.5 fix.
- Dan
