That is creating the symlink for the class device to show up properly in
/sys/class.
For example, the /sys/class/net/eth0 entry will be a symlink pointing to
the proper device.
Oh, DOH!  That will fail if CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED is enabled because
that symlink can not be created because the device itself is already
called that and has been registered with sysfs in that location.
That might fix my other problem I am now seeing which happens when a
device is removed from the system at startup with that config option
enabled.  Let me go rework this and see if it solves the issue...
thanks for the big hint, I was tracking it down through a different path
and hadn't gotten here yet.
