Note the value of EIP, and compare it with the structure size of
"struct module".

Naaa, its old modutils.  Upgrade to 2.3.21 and this problem will disappear.
(explaination: with old modutils, the kernel "forgets" to copy some bytes
into module space, which causes these zero'd bytes.  modutils 2.3.21 fixes
this.  In addition, the kernel bug has also been fixed in the current pre
patches, but this is not a recommendation to try the pre kernels out).
