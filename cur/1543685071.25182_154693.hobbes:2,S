Physical space?  Power usage?  Heat dissipation?  Optimization for the 
specific task?  Fast, low latency communication between CPU and device 
(ie. local bus)?  Maintenance?
Lots of reasons why one might pay more for the offload card.  If you're 
cheap, you'll just use the software stack and a $10 NIC and just live 
with the corresponding CPU usage.  If you're a performance freak, you'll 
spend whatever you have to to squeeze out every last bit of performance 
you can.
Mind you, another option is, if you're dealing with the kind of load 
that requires that much network performance, is to use redundant 
servers, like google.  No one server is exceptionally fast, but it not 
many people are using it, it's fast enough.
