The point isn't what kmap and kunmap do ... it's the addresses they
return.  By and large, a kernel virtual address for a page is different
from the user virtual address.  If the cache is virtually indexed you
get different cache lines for the same page ... and that sets you up
with aliases you need to resolve.  parisc is the same ... our
kmap/kunmap are nops as well, but our kernel virtual addresses are still
different from the user virtual ones.
