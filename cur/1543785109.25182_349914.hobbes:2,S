Well, I never really said "Not interested".  There was just
nothing I could do.  By that time I know from our
original LSI/HP/SAS list that those folks have moved away
from what I was doing, plus I had my own work to do.
As to your work, or integration or whatever you decide
to do, I'm willing to help in anyway I can.

Well, both source code are public, people can read the code themselves
and make that decision for themselves.  There is no point us in discussing
this.

Christoph, there is smart engineers in companies too, not only in the Linux
community.

I see.

I don't mind using "transport attribute class" for JB's class,
and "SAS Transport Layer" for the recent code submission.
That is, by design, JB tried to unify _attributes_ across _all_
transports.  Not an easy feat by any means, but we shall leave
that at that.
While, by design (and SAM), the SAS Transport Layer, literally
sits between the interconnect and SCSI Core (SAM to be).
This separation is clear and distinct.

Yes, this is very noble to have and do.
Figuring out _what_ we can have common, in such different and
distinct engineering architectures, Open Transport vs. MPT,
is not an easy feat by any means.
I don't have an indepth knowlege in MPT as you do, clearly since
I don't have specs, etc, but if you have questions or concerns
please don't hesitate to email, I'd gladly help with anything I can.
