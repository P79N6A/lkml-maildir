Unfortunately, it's not at all as simple as all that. Toshiharu is quite
correct that it isn't always easy to actually implement.  Consider how
many ad-croc usages of 'restorecon' are needed to get a Fedora SELinux box
through rc.sysinit:
% grep restorecon /etc/rc.sysinit
if [ -n "$SELINUX_STATE" -a -x /sbin/restorecon ] && LC_ALL=C fgrep -q " /dev " /proc/mounts ; then
        /sbin/restorecon  -R /dev 2>/dev/null
    REBOOTFLAG=`restorecon -v /sbin/init`
[ -n "$SELINUX_STATE" ] && restorecon /dev/pts >/dev/null 2>&1
[ -n "$SELINUX_STATE" ] && restorecon /dev/mapper /dev/mapper/control >/dev/null 2>&1
                        [ -n "$SELINUX_STATE" -a -e "$path" ] && restorecon -R "$path"
                                [ -n "$SELINUX_STATE" -a -e "$path" ] && restorecon -R "$path"
                                [ -n "$SELINUX_STATE" -a -e "$path" ] && restorecon -R "$path"
   restorecon /etc/mtab /etc/ld.so.cache /etc/blkid/blkid.tab /etc/resolv.conf >/dev/null 2>&1
[ -n "$SELINUX_STATE" ] && restorecon /tmp
[ -n "$SELINUX_STATE" ] && restorecon /tmp/.ICE-unix >/dev/null 2>&1
And that's just getting the system up to single-user.  Things like sendmail
and sshd require more restorecon handholding in their rc.init files.
Or just look at the creeping horror that is 'restorecond' (in particular,
consider that the default restorcond.conf contains the strings '~/public_html'
and '~/.mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so'.  Yee. Frikkin. Hah. ;)
