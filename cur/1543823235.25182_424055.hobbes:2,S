Looking at this again...  The ttl isn't copied into 'ttl' unless the
check_set has TTL turned on.  This means that the overwritting was fine,
if you accept that you can only ever match on TTL, or never match on it.
That doesn't seem right to me.  The TTL in the table should always be
kept up-to-date and the only question is if the current rule requires it
for a match or not.  This isn't a huge change, just set the local
variable always but check for if it's asked to match before calling the
lookup.  Or you could move it into an if/else block.
