Well, I guess it's time for me to comment, then.   I have been watching
with great interest.
I have to say, I totally agree that this is a problem that needs solving.
The current situation is a mess....
But, I'm not sure this is much better.  It's certainly different, but I
fear that we're going to spend a lot of time explaining to end-users a new
and less-than-totally-obvious system.
Technically, this is much better than what we have.  I'm just not sure
about the "end user experience".
And I think I'm totally convinced now that request_module() needs some
serious help.  Either it needs to go away entirely, or be replaced by a
helper, such that request_module() gets a module loaded, but module
binding to a device is controlled via another mechanism.
Overall, send it to Andrew's tree.  But I'd really like to see it live
there for an extended period of time before going to Linus.  And I'd also
like to see some ideas for the final solution, which would apply to HID
devices with the same problem.
I hate solving problems twice.  It creates twice as much work for everyone,
including distro folks and end-users.  Let's figure this out as a more
generic driver-binding problem for all drivers once and for all.
