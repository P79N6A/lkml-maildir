I'm not sure what your problem is, but I have both RedHat 5.2 and
RedHat 6.0 systems on my private network, and I have cdrom drives
exported both ways without problem.
The only problem I have noted is that kernels 2.2.9 and 2.2.10 appear
to have problems with the nfs daemon, as it refuses to start up under
those kernels. On 2.2.9 it just fails silently, and on 2.2.10 it
reports that nfssvc is not available...
When I need to export from RH 6.0, I'm using the 2.2.5-22 kernel as
supplied by RedHat on their updates.redhat.com site, but I also
exported them with the 2.2.5-15 kernel that came with the CD, so if
you haven't updated, that isn't your problem.
Incidentally, I also have the CD's exported from RH 6.0 using SaMBa to
systems running Win95, and that works under 2.2.10 so you could always
try that...
Best wishes from Riley.
