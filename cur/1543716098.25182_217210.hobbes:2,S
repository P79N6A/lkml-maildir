I think if your system clock is as good as 2 minutes per day you are
'normal'.  System clocks are generally very stable but not very accurate,
ie. they will consistently gain or lose the same ammount per day, but not
be that good.  That is one of the reasons NTP is very effective on a
system, it can figure out how rubbish your clock is and correct for it
because of that stability.
