Yeah, did you answer one of my arguments except claiming that I'm to
stupid to understand how it works ? 
I completely understand what this code does and I don't beat on the
patch size. I beat on the timing burden and restrictions which are given
by the implementation.
I have no objection against relayfs itself. I can just leave the config
switch off, so it does not affect me.
Adding instrumentation to the kernel is a good thing. 
I just dont like the idea, that instrumentation is bound on relayfs and
adds a feature to the kernel which fits for a restricted set of problems
rather than providing a generic optimized instrumentation framework,
where one can use relayfs as a backend, if it fits his needs. Making
this less glued together leaves the possibility to use other backends.

Just doing codepath analysis shows me:
There is a loop in ltt_log_event, which enforces the processing of each
event twice. Spliting traces is postprocessing and can be done
elsewhere.
In _ltt_log_event lives quite a bunch of if(...) processing decisions
which have to be evaluated for _each_ event.
The relay_reserve code can loop in the do { } while() and even go into a
slow path where another do { } while() is found.
So it can not be used in fast paths and for timing related problem
tracking, because it adds variable time overhead.
Due to the fact, that the ltt_log_event path is not preempt safe you can
actually hit the additional go in the do { } while() loop.
I pointed out before, that it is not possible to selectively select the
events which I'm interested in during compile time. I get either nothing
or everything. If I want to use instrumentation for a particular
problem, why must I process a loop of _ltt_log_event calls for stuff I
do not need instead of just compiling it away ?
If I compile a event in, then adding a couple of checks into the
instrumentation macro itself does not hurt as much as leaving the
straight code path for a disabled event.
