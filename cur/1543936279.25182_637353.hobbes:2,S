To make it simpler to use .. A good percentage (if not all) command line
unix data processing utils accept piped data directly, without the need
for the "-" .. That's the expect usage .. checkpatch.pl doesn't need to
deviate from the norm, there is no size constraint, there is no line
limit .. So we're not duplicating functionality, we're making the tool
conform ..
