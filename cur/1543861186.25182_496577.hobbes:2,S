The thing is, I agree with you - it does seem to be compiler-related. But 
at the same time, I'm almost positive that it's not in "pipe_poll()" 
itself, because that function is just too simple, and looking at the 
assembly code, I don't see how what you describe could happen in THAT 
function.
HOWEVER.
I can easily see an NMI coming in, or another interrupt, or something, and 
that one corrupting the stack under it because of a compiler bug (or a 
kernel bug that just needs a specific compiler to trigger). For example, 
we've had problems before with the compiler thinking it owns the stack 
frame for an "asmlinkage" function, and us having no way to tell the 
compiler to keep its hands off - so the compiler ended up touching 
registers that were actually in the "save area" of the interrupt or system 
call, and then returning with corrupted state.
Here's a stupid patch. It just adds more debugging to the oops message, 
and shows all the code pointers it can find on the WHOLE stack.
It also makes the raw stack dumping print out as much of the stack 
contents _under_ the stack pointer as it does above it too.
However, this patch is mostly useless if you have a separate stack for 
IRQ's (since if that happens, any interrupt will be taken on a different 
stack which we don't see any more), so you should NOT enable the 4KSTACKS 
config option if you try this out.
I'm not sure how enlightening any of the output might be, but it is 
probably worth trying.
