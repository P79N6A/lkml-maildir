There is no problem with that, i.e. the changes are trivial (except
for pci_map_*, but that's another story).
I don't know if it wouldn't break something, though. x86-64 and ia64
are much less tested than i386 and the change would alter i386
behaviour to that of x86-64/ia64.
Again: which driver uses the consistent_dma_mask and where I can find it?
