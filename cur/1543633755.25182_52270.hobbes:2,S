The layers can cope with the switch easily enough.  The problem is that to 
send an untagged command to a SCSI device you have to wait for the outstanding 
tags to clear which is what causes the stall.  The scsi mid-layer queue push 
back system pushes all commands back to the BIO layer marked as REQ_SPECIAL 
(because the upper layer drivers generate the commands and it has no idea what 
they are supposed to be doing) if the driver cannot handle them.  This means 
for those drivers (like the new adaptec) which load up the device until it 
returns a queue full (thus causing push back into the bio layer) we'd get 
stutter in the command pipeline.  The cleanest solution is to allow (but not 
require) tagging of every request type.

I thought about doing this.  The problem is that the blk layer doesn't have 
very good instrumentation for detecting the condition.  The SCSI layer is the 
one that has per command timers and all the other necessaries so it can detect 
when a command should have returned and take corrective action.
