/tmp/cc6m8eDA.o: In function `gentbl_offscostab':
/tmp/cc6m8eDA.o(.text+0x64): undefined reference to `cos'

Makefile uses HOST_LOADLIBES instead of HOST_LOADLIBS.  That is what
happens when you use magic variables that cannot be syntax checked,
errors go undetected until somebody uses the option.
Not a problem for kbuild 2.5 of course, it has a syntax checker.
