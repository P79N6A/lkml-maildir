They're HOPING for that.
There is currently a call out to find all machines that work with zImage
but not bzImage so they can make bzImage work on them and then get rid of
zImage.
Apparently one was found here.
They really really want zImage to go away.  Rather than trying to get
zImage to work on this particular computer again, I'd suggest concentrate
on trying to get bzImage to work.
