Hello!
I recently attempted to upgrade a compaq nx5000 laptop (Pentium-M)
to 2.6.13.  The system boots fine until it gets to the line:
Starting udev:  MAKEDEV: mkdir: File exists
The next line:  Initializing hardware...
never prints anything else.
The return key seems to work..nothing else I've tried does.
I also tried 2.6.13.2.  The kernel config is same as that of the latest
FC4 kernel (which is 2.6.12.something and works fine).
The kernel is built on an FC2 machine running 2.6.11, if that matters.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Ben
