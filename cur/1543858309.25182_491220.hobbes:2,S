I believe the error is reported back to SCSI, which attempts to follow
up with TEST UNIT READY.  Unfortunately, for some reason the device then
gets dropped.  libata normally calls __scsi_add_device with lun=0, but
SAS calls scsi_scan_target with lun=SCAN_WILD_CARD, which is why SCSI
sends REPORT LUNs in the first place.
As an alternative I suppose we could detect ATA devices in sas_rphy_add
and change that SCAN_WILD_CARD to "0".
