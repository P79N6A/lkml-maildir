Sorry I was not clear on my point.
I was trying to point out that, an exit hook for BSD and CSA is
essential to save accounting data before the data is gone. That
can not be done with a netlink.
So, my patch was to keep acct_process as a wrapper, which
would then call do_exit_csa() for CSA and call do_acct_process
for BSD.
Thanks,
