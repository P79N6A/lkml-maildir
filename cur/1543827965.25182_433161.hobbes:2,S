As a user, it's great if this fixes people's keyboards and mice. But it's
not a panacea. Gkrellm reads CPU temperatures from
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*/temperature and that disturbs a time-critical
application like mplayer, both when reading normal video and hacked mms:
sound streams (ogg sound is OK, though):
rtc: lost some interrupts at 1024Hz.
rtc: lost some interrupts at 1024Hz.
The loss frequency is much lower with this patch, by something like an
estimated 5-10 times.
Also, here the notebook's touchpad gets clobbered by temperature reads
when dragging a small xterm window around:

So, here temperature reading stays off even if this patch hits mainline.
Battery reading is fine, strangely enough. Perhaps because I've set
a period of 30 seconds between updates.
Or it might be that a lot of work has gone in regarding acpi BAT...
