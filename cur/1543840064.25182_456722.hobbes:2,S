Hmm.  Seems dangerous to rely on this, because functions could change 
from inline to out of line without people noticing that it affects this 
very corner case for kprobes + paravirt + stop_machine.  Is there a way 
to cascade the __kprobes declaration to all called functions, perhaps 
with a static checker, like sparse?
