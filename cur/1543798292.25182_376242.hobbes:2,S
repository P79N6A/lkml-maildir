Hi,
I want to implement a congestion control algorithm for an Ad-hoc wireless
network. It means i will make some modifications to TCP and therefore in
the transport layer.
Do i need to modify the Kernel to do my implementation? or there are some
kernel modules i can modify as for the case of implementing a routing
protocol in the network layer? If both are possible what could be the
advantage or disadvantage of each? Where can i get more information?
Thank you in advance,
Nadia Ramirez
