I just upgraded a SpaceWalker SV-50 machine with a builtin Realtek
nic.  The NIC can no longer receive pkts it seems.  It can transmit
fine, as witnessed by other machines on the network.
lspci says the realtek is:
RTL-8139/8139C (rev 10)
The NIC is plugged into a 10bt hub.
The messages in /var/log/messages look like:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
eth0: Setting half-duplex based on auto-negotiated partner ability 0000
I tested in on a 100bt-FD switch, and it failed there too, though it
did have a message in the log about negotiating 100bt-FD.
This works in stock RH 7.3 kernel.
Thanks,
Ben
