That's interesting.  It will be informative to narrow down the variables 
affected by this.  My changes stirred the pot quite a bit :)
* 'throughput' mode enables MSI-X, and separate interrupt vectors for RX 
and TX.  so, NVIDIA's MSI-X implementation, our generic MSI-X support, 
or "Known bugs" (see top of file) may be a factor here.
* 'throughput' mode also changes the NIC's timer interrupt frequency
* do you recall if you were running in NAPI mode?  It defaulted to off 
in Kconfig, but I turned it on unconditionally.
* I think TX NAPI has the potential to make the optimization_mode 
irrelevant (along with the other changes, most notably the interrupt 
handling change)
* and overall, yes, if we can have a single queueing model / 
optimization mode I am strongly in favor of that.
Testing welcome ;-)  Though these patches are raw and "hot off the 
presses", so unrelated bugs are practically a certainty.  And I am 
worrying about the "Known bugs" note at the top.  My gut feeling is that 
this was, in part, misunderstanding on the part of reverse-engineers, 
since corrected when NVIDIA started contributing to the driver.
