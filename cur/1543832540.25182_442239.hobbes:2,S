Subject: selinux: two conditional.h files

There are two conditional.h files:
  security/selinux/include/conditional.h
  security/selinux/ss/conditional.h
This is quite confusing since security/selinux/ss/Makefile contains
  EXTRA_CFLAGS += -Isecurity/selinux/include
and it's therefore easy to misunderstand the effects of an
  #include "conditional.h"
Can you rename one of these two headers?
TIA
