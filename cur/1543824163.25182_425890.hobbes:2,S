I had a quick gander at some of the consoles registered under arch. A
lot of them look like they'd be ok running with CON_ANYTIME, ie. they
just write to a fixed address or uart or something simple.
Having said that I still think we should leave this patch as is, and
leave it up to arch people to decide whether they want to add
CON_ANYTIME to their particular console driver.
cheers
