Thanks I have looked at the attached file and I would really not like to 
access a file from the kernel but I cannot seem to get the user land app to 
work with writing. If you consider a kernel module which, in some event, 
needs to save some information in a file. The usr app is blocked in a read 
with interruptible_sleep_on. When the first write occurs the module calls 
wake_up_interruptible to write the data. Before the module can write the next 
chunk of data it needs to stall until the user process has finished. 
I can not find a method of stalling the module so it seems my only solution 
is to write the file from the kernel or dump the data somewhere manually.
Cheers
Simon.
