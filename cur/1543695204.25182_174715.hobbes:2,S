I know someone noted that frandom couldn't just replace urandom, but I
don't recall why. The values appear to be at least a good, the speed is
much higher, and since it's already in use, there would be no opposition
to having it, since we need to have something.
Could someone clarify why this isn't a drop-in replacement?

No argument, but the performance of urandom is quite poor in terms of
speed and having every application generate their own number using
their own possibly badly flawed algorithm certainly qualifies as
undesirable.
