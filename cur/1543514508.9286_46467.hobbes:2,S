well, it obviously and easily corrupted my filesystem (and others'
filesystems) about a 100 times until i found the change that triggered (or
caused) it, so would you mind testing it on low memory conditions?
(running with mem=32m for a while on an SMP box and hacking the kernel
should be just fine for you see the filesystem corruption)

(yep, saw it too, that indeed might be the explanation - but i've had
enough filesystems trashed for the time being :)
