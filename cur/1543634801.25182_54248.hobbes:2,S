Hmm...
	I've only applied the one that was an actually a definite
spellfix.  While I prefer to use apostrophes, it's a common
abbreviation to skip it: 1/10 according to google.  Compare with
another common misspelling (recieve) which is 1/50.
Given there is a non-zero cost (patch conflict with developers) even
with trivial patches, I've decided not to apply your 41
"doesnt"->"doesn't" patches, unless someone convinces me otherwise.
Cheers,
Rusty.
