Hi all,
Thanks to all of you answering to my post.

I have seen the problem in delay_tsc(), but I was pusled by these lines
in my dmesg:

I thought (sort of) acpi_pm (but not tsc) is used in udelay().
The same delay_tsc() is used in both arches: i386 & x86_64
(and as I see from the proposed patches in -mm, also for 
the new x86 arch). Should the patch be applied for all of them?
Quite similar function ia64_itc_udelay() is used in IA64, but one
find a coment before it:
/*
 * Generic udelay assumes that if preemption is allowed and the thread
 * migrates to another CPU, that the ITC values are synchronized across
 * all CPUs.
 */
Are they really synchronized or similar patch: preempt_disable/enable()
should be applied?
What about all other arches?
Thanks.
