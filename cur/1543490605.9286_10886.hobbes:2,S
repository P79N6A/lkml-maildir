Subject: ...anyone seeing strange network black-out since 2.2.2?

This is just to check: the problem could be local and the fact I
expose, just coincidences. 
Since 2.2.2 I experience strange network lookup: during 5min-20minutes
I have a complete black out of connection to all the host that are
behind a bridge. It seems that the arp reply is never processed, or
received. A host with 2.2.1 on the same cable is working well.
Any idea?
