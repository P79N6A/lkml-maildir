It's not an "either or" situation.  You can have both.
As I said recently in other mail on this topic, the only thing that 
needs to be resolved when you have both caps and guarantees is which one 
has precedence if they conflict.  Of course, one solution to this is to 
disallow conflicting caps and guarantees but that is really just the 
same as saying whichever was set first has precedence.

No, but it can be used to make sure certain tasks don't hog the CPU and 
prevent other tasks from getting their job done.

Yes, guarantees would be better for that problem but this doesn't mean 
that caps are useless.  Also an equivalent situation where caps are a 
better solution to guarantees would be easy to generate.  Ergo both 
mechanisms are useful.
For the ordinary user, I think that the most useful feature of this 
patch is the ability to impose a soft cap of zero on a task and for that 
cap to be inherited by its children (which it is).  This is a very 
useful for running a job (such as a kernel build) in the background.  If 
you look at the kernbench numbers that I enclosed you will note that, in 
the absence of other load on the computer, the increase in the build 
time using this feature is very small.  The advantages of having the 
build run in the background are improved responsiveness for those 
interactive tasks we're using (e.g. editing files, reading/writing mail 
etc.) while the build is in progress.
