No, if you're not a maintainer then you still send them to the maintainer in 
the MAINTAINERS file.
The interesting question is, who does THAT maintainer send them to.  (We seem 
to be heading for a four-tiered system, with Linus at the top, a dozen or so 
lieutenants under him, and then the specific maintainers under them.  With 
individual developers submitting patches being the fourth tier.  Patches go 
from developer, to maintainer, to lieutenant, to linus.)
This doesn't sound like a bad thing for scalability reasons, and should also 
help address the "I sent my patch directly to linus a dozen times and I 
didn't hear back" problem.
The problem right now is a lot of the maintainers don't seem to know who 
their corresponding lieutenant is.  We're still waiting for clarification 
from Linus...

I didn't spot one in MAINTAINERS.  The email at the top of "mount.h" says:
> * Author:  Marco van Wieringen <mvw@planets.elm.net>
So that might be a good person to ask.  Of course who knows how old that 
email address is... :)
