Yep, that's O(n^2) algorithm slowing it down. I have fix for it, but
2.6.10 is now too frozen for performance fix to go in. See "bigdiff" I
sent to hugang, or wait few minutes and you'll get really ugly diff in
private email, that should solve it, too.
[I'll be glad when you report results. It should make count_data_pages
< 1 second].

Ok, it is the scale. Half a second speedup is not enough to justify
new compression algorithm in the kernel.
