Hello!
The Linux-sound list appears to be dead (I don't see my message in
http://www.kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-sound/
), so I'm sending to the
authors and the people discussing the problem on the linux-kernel mailing
list.
An additional problem is that opl3 cannot find the device unless I load
and unload the old driver (ymf_sb). Probably the new driver should put the
OPL3 interface to the legacy mode if it cannot handle it directly.
This confirms my point that you should not disable building both drivers
as modules at this stage.
Regards,
Pavel Roskin

Subject: YMF PCI - thanks, glitches, patches
Hello!
The native YMF PCI driver from Linux-2.4.0-test12-pre5 works on my card:
Dec  5 18:07:11 fonzie kernel: ymfpci0: YMF740C at 0xf0000000 IRQ 10
Dec  5 18:07:11 fonzie kernel: ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id:
0x4144:0x5303 (Unknown)
Thanks to everybody who made it!
Now about problems. Sometimes I get such messages in the log:
Dec  5 18:08:16 fonzie kernel: ymfpci: ioctl cmd 0x5401
Dec  5 18:08:50 fonzie last message repeated 9 times
While playing some sounds I'm getting
$ play spinout.wav
sox: Unable to set audio speed to 5512 (set to 8000)
$ file spinout.wav
spinout.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 8 bit,
mono 5512 Hz
This always happens for some sounds, and never happens for others. This
message doesn't appear with the old driver (ymf_sb). I'm attaching
spinout.wav.
The next problem is the configuration file, linux/drivers/sound/Config.in.
I'm sending you a patch that fixes the following problems:
1) The new driver does not depend (directly or indirectly) on the OSS
sound.o module, thus CONFIG_SOUND_YMFPCI should not depend on
CONFIG_SOUND_OSS.
2) CONFIG_SOUND_YMFPCI should depend on CONFIG_PCI. You cannot compile the
driver without PCI support.
3) Both drivers (native and legacy) should disable the other driver if
eigther of them is to be compiled into the kernel. However, it should be
possible to compile both drivers as modules. I did it so I can compare
them.
4) Don't forget about spaces in the description.
You may also want to add a dependency to CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL for
CONFIG_SOUND_YMFPCI (not in my patch) if you feel that the driver is not
ready for everybody. Just writing (EXPERIMENTAL) doesn't disable the
question about the driver when CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is not set.
The patch also contains minimal descriptions for CONFIG_SOUND_YMPCI and
CONFIG_SOUND_YMFPCI. I hope somebody will add more stuff there.
By the way, I'm surprised why many drivers for PCI sound cards don't
depend on CONFIG_PCI.
Regards,
Pavel Roskin
