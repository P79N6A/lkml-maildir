I would suggest that it's not any more clumsy; the implementation is
fairly obvious and the _use_ of it is just the same. But I won't bother,
because it's largely pointless to compare something functional with
something non-functional.

I have warnings from GCC already, thank you very much. I see no
particular reason to hack on the compiler to give me new ways of
achieving what I've already had for years. But if someone else were to
do so I'd have no particular objection to switching over to using it.
Let's see it merged first though, before you suggest that people should
use it instead of what actually _works_ today.
