  As a datapoint, I've had 2.4.0-test9pre6 up over 1.5 days doing
some serious compiling for a piece of that (probably a good 6-8 hours,
but I haven't timed it with my new AMD processor lately).
  I'm running X 4.0.1.  I don't know where the `c' and `d' bits you
guys are talking about is coming from.  This is the source and patches
I grabbed off of XFree86's website.
  I haven't seen any fatal lockups.  In the past I've apparently been
lucky since I'm running a 2.4.0.x kernel with 256MB of RAM and SMP on
a non-SMP machine, but there is a reason I do that.  (:
  I was running 2.4.0-test9pre2 (no X at all) for 4 DAYS before that
with no known problems.
  Unfortunately, I'm running syslogd-ng-1.4.5 with seems to stop syslogging
output after some period of time, so I can't tell if I'm catching all
the warning messages that I might, even if they're not deadlocking me.
