Actually, it's worse than that.  Users have been trained that when a
computer bluescreens and losing all of their data, it's either (a)
just the way things are, or (b) it's microsoft's fault.  Worse yet,
thanks to things like PC benchmarks, hard drive manutacturers have in
the past been encouraged to do things like lie to the OS about when
things had hit the hard drive platter just to score higher numbers on
winbench.
All of this is why I've in the past summed all of this up as Ted's law
of PC class hardware, which is that PC class hardware is cr*p.  :-)
