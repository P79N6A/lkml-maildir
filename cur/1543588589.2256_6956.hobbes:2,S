  I have noticed a problem with sound lately.  I have a cs46xx card and 
it randomly gets distorted.  Normally I just reboot but on this last 
occurence I simply left it as it was.  The distortion sounds someone 
punched the speaker core, it's tinny and mangled.  Today it fixed itself 
out of the blue in the middle of playing a sound. All sound programs are 
equally affected.
It's only done this in the 2.4 series, I haven't had the desire to look 
into it.
