I can see no easy solution for this... If Linus decides to fork off 
2.7, development efforts will go into 2.7 and fixes should get 
backported to 2.6. If Linus decides to stay with 2.6, new development 
will have to be "conservative" enough not to break things that were 
working.
I tend to prefer forking off 2.7: more agressive features can be 
implemented and tested without bothering disrupting the stable 2.6 
branch.
