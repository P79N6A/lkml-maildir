Hi,
For a while now I've been meaning to get DRI running with my rv350
graphics card on my AMD64 machine. However I don't seem to be able to
get the right config-fu in the kernel to enable all the components.
For my sins I've been following the Gentoo Howto Wiki
(
http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_DRI_with_ATi_Open-Source_Drivers
)
A lot of the AGP stuff in the Kernel seems to be locked to 32 bit
kernels. The instructions seem to imply there is an am64-agp module
(which looks as though it builds in the tree but doesn't install) and
possibly an nvidea-agp module. I'm a little confused as I have both AMD
and NVidia chipsets on my machine:

Any clues on the correct AGP config options to switch on gratefully
received. My current .config looks like:
08:56 alex@malory [linux-2.6-stable.git] >grep "AGP" .config
CONFIG_AGP=y
CONFIG_AGP_AMD64=y
CONFIG_AGP_INTEL=m
# CONFIG_AGP_SIS is not set
CONFIG_AGP_VIA=m
08:59 alex@malory [linux-2.6-stable.git] >grep "DRM" .config
CONFIG_DRM=m
# CONFIG_DRM_TDFX is not set
# CONFIG_DRM_R128 is not set
CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=m
# CONFIG_DRM_I810 is not set
# CONFIG_DRM_I830 is not set
# CONFIG_DRM_I915 is not set
