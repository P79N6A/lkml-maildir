glibc supports .note.ABI-tag notes for libraries, so there is no problem
with having NPTL libpthread.so.0 --enable-kernel=2.5.36 in say
/lib/i686/libpthread.so.0 and linuxthreads --enable-kernel=2.2.1 in
/lib/libpthread.so.0. The dynamic linker will then choose based
on currently running kernel.
(well, ATM because of libc tsd DL_ERROR --without-tls ld.so cannot be used
with --with-tls libs and vice versa, but that is beeing worked on).
That's similar to non-FLOATING_STACK and FLOATING_STACK linuxthreads,
the latter can be used with 2.4.8+ or something kernels on IA-32.

Because all of glibc/gcc/binutils TLS support was developed together (and
still is)? All the changes are publicly available, mostly in the
corresponding CVS archives.
