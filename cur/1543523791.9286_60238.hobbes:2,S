Short of running the process chain and extracting the command line to
modprobe, no.

Your code has control over the name that is passed to request_module.
I am not keen on kernel code asking for anything other than a single
name, it smacks too much of user policy migrating into the kernel.
Instead you can code /etc/modules.conf like this
alias char-major-98-1 comedi
options char-major-98-1 minor=1
alias char-major-98-2 comedi
options char-major-98-2 minor=2
options comedi major=98 irq=6 io=0x300
Options from the alias source and target are merged together before
calling insmod.
