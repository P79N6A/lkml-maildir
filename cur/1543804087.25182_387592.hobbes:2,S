Irrelevant. If "atomic_add_unless()" is in a hot path and inlined, we're 
doing something else wrong anyway. It's not a good op to use. Just think 
of it as being very expensive.
The _only_ user of "atomic_add_unless()" is "dec_and_lock()", which isn't 
even inlined. The fact that gcc ends up "unrolling" the loop once is just 
fine.
Please keep it that way.
