here's a example :

Opaque types should be no problem. However the complete definition must reside
somewhere _inside_ the complete source. Opaque types is even a bless, i agree.
It summarizes code to only reflect what is essential, instead of repeating
tedious and long struct types and defines. However if Opaque types are used
inside a partial_source tree, where the complete definition is hidden
inside the binary only closed source parts, then its the complete opposite
of what i would call a bless.
