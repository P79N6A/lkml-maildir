Install 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops/ksymoops-0.7c.tar.gz.
  Then
  ksymoops -v /usr/src/linux/vmlinux -s /var/tmp/map < /dev/null
will build a complete system map containing every useful symbol from
vmlinux, from System.map and from loaded modules.  No need to reinvent
the wheel.

All symbols are loaded when the kernel is loaded.  objdump --headers
/usr/src/vmlinux gives you the size and location of each section of
data or code.

See arch/<architecture>/mm/init.c, function free_initmem.  It frees all
pages from __init_begin to __init_end.

Read arch/<architecture>/vmlinux.lds and see what sections are included
between __init_begin and __init_end.

Read the source, Luke :)
