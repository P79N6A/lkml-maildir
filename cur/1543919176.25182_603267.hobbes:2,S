That's what I had thought too after a quick LKML search.  Doing a bit 
more research (I'm starting to think the IT8871F on the chip is 
misleading) it looks like that support is for a single parallel multi 
I/O card (with the other 887x cards being serial/parport PCI cards).

The kernel I'm using has 16 for both the NR_UARTS and RUNTIME_UARTS 
(these machines generally have a minimum of 4 ports).  dmesg doesn't 
show the kernel as recognizing the card and only ttyS0 and ttyS1 (the 
two onboard ports) show up on boot.
