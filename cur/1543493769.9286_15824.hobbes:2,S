Ah. It's not a bug it's a feature.  It wasn't what I was expecting
but it appears it works.  And has the nice feature of not incurring 
any read cost for write only files.
Now that I understand whats happening in generic_file_write
I'm not going to worry about it anymore for 2.2.
For 2.3 though I'm going to seriously revisit generic_file_write.  
In particular:
1) It clears the PageLock after calling updatepage.  This isn't 
   compatible with block based writes (for asynchronous filesystems).
   (i.e brw_page). 
2) We do so much serialization when writing files it's spooky.
   The page lock, the inode semaphore, and the kernel lock.
   It's my gut feeling that running the right application
   on a smp system,  we would feel the unnecessary serialization.
I know it definitely makes a difference in databases wether they
do page level or record level locking.
