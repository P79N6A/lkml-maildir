Ok I have a problem here. You are Ulrich Drepper and you are _the_
maintainer of glibc and I am Han Boetes and I am a C noob. It's
like Kasparov trying to explain something to a club-chess-player.
I'm afraid that whatever explanation you give to me is over my
head, you'll feel like talking to a dummy and I'll be terribly
unsatisfied.
To avoid that I would like to ask you if you can show me some
example-code, something I which can compile and run and see for
myself, for the following situations:
1) Where an application compiled with PP is working worse or even
   failing where it would work right without PP.
2) Where a bufferoverflow can be exploited even though the
   application is compiled with PP.
As an example where PP does work right the test-code provided by
the propolice maintainer:
    /* test-propolice.c */
    #define OVERFLOW "This is longer than 10 bytes"
    #include <string.h>
    int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
        char buffer[10];
        strcpy(buffer, OVERFLOW);
        return 0;
    }
