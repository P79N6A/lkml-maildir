yup, I did see that.  I've gone through the code and I can't
see anything wrong with it (tell me if I've missed something).
If the problem is simply that its using strtok, then this must
just be a perceived problem rather than an actual problem (the
data is copied, and noone uses it other than the parsing code,
afaict).
