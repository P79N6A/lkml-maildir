Yay, I see now. It takes a fair amount of looking behind the scene to get the
idea. (It's just copy-and-paste from an O'reilly book with a few
modifications.)
Yes, there is always only one way from any insn you look at, which does not
require a lock.

I'd like to be able to hit Ctrl+C (in the userspace application) whenever
possible. If that's not a reason, blame the book
http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/ch03.html#t8
 ("the read method" a further
down below)
BTW, the complete book is at
