From looking at the source, the architectures I found to be doing
scatterlist coalescing in some cases were alpha, ia64, parisc (some
code under drivers), powerpc, sparc64 and x86_64.
I agree with you that it would be possible for them to do the coalescing
by just adjusting dma_address and dma_length (though it's architecture-
dependent whether there are such fields at all), not interfering with
the input page and length; and maybe some of them do proceed that way.
I didn't find the coalescing code in any of them very easy to follow.
So please examine arch/x86_64/kernel/pci_gart.c gart_map_sg (and
dma_map_cont which it calls): x86_64 was the architecture on which
the problem was really found with drivers/scsi/st.c, and avoided
by that boot option iommu=nomerge.
Lines like "*sout = *s;" and "*sout = sg[start];" are structure-
copying whole scallerlist entries from one position in the list
to another, without explicit mention of the page and length fields.

The API is commendably clear that they may be modified.  Like you I'd
prefer it to be otherwise, and instead guarantee that they won't be:
that would prevent this kind of surprise.  But it's not how it is;
and looking at the various pieces of coalescing code, I quickly
abandoned my first inclination, to adjust them to make it so.
