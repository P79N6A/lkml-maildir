Hm, is the period with interrupts off during shutdown much greater with
ACPI than with APM?  Maybe it is just simply that ...
You could sprinkle calls to
	touch_nmi_watchdog()
in the ACPI shutdown code and see if the problem goes away ...
I am also curious about Andrew's question - does the system properly
shutdown without nmi-watchdog?  The case could be that interrupts are
disabled and ACPI then goes to shut the system down, fails, and the
system just sits (like, say, a Windows 9x machine :>) and finally the
watchdog causes an OOPS.  This seems most likely, in fact.
