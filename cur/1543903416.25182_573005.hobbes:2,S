Note that if/endif actually translates to a "depends on" for every
contained object. I prefer the reduced clutter [if/endif] over having
explicit depends on on every object, since it is redundant.

"menuconfig" is not a start marker like "menu" was. Hence it has no "stop"
marker either. We would need a new object type for that.
