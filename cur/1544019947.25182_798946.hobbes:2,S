There's one bug that your version highlights in mine - the virtual mpu
clock in omap1 touches the DPLL and repropagates that rate.  I've
removed that repropagation, so that needs fixing.
However, this raises a question: why is the virtual mpu clock touching
some other part of the clock tree.  I wonder whether this should be
handled a different way, though the first thing that needs answering is
why we have this alias for 'arm_ck' ?
