Side note: I considered just changing do_utimes() to use 
ATIME_SET/MTIME_SET instead, which would simplify the logic a lot..
But it turns out that the semantics for A/MTIME_SET is that only the owner 
of the file can do that. So the "!times" case is simply _fundamentally_ 
different from a permissions check standpoint, and there we have to check 
for "writable" rather than anything else (although ownership will override 
it).
So rather than simplify the thing, I had to add code. Oh, well.
I do think that it would be even nicer to just have a function that fills 
in the "struct nameidata" from the dfd. I think we should be able to: the 
"struct file" really does have the "f_path" thing with both dentry and mnt 
information, and that would clean up that whole ugly "filepointer-vs-nd" 
thing a lot.
That would be an "Al cleanup", though. What do you think, Al?
