FYI, xfree86 is working on a x86 emulator for just this purpose:
initializing multiple cards where the bios doesn't.
Interestingly, I can use an S3 as the primary adapter (for X) + the matrox
framebuffer (matroxfb) on my uninitialized second gfx card.
Xfree86, however, will just freeze the machine when it tries to take over
the framebuffer'ed gfx card.

I think thats a bug in your BIOS (some get it right, interestingly), and
if would be ultra-cool if linux worked around it, since this is very
common on pcs.
