fork()ed processes are *identical* to their parents execept for the return 
value from fork().  They have the same shared memory handles, file 
descriptors, etc.  The kernel "knows" that there's an extra copy of each, and 
updates it's link counts, etc.
Actually, the real point is that it'll still be the old executable running 
with the old libraries, until you shut down the whole group.  Each of the 
processes are "linked" to the original file, so the new version will never 
run 'til the whole group is restarted.
It should just work.  I can't think of any reason why it shouldn't.
