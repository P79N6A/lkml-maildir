Here we go.....
You need to check with both WD and Maxtor, they do not play well togather
in Linux in general.  You may be a candidate for the "piix.c" chipset
code to force set the host adapter.
In many cases, a WD DMA mode 2 (p) with a Maxtor UDMA mode 2 (s) on the
same interface will cause problems.  Timing Chatter.
Call Maxtor and see if they will verify this again and they may offer to
assist you in getting rid of your WD door stop/paper weight.
No I am not a WD fan, after they rudely blew me off.
