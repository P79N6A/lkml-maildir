Hi Tony,
This patch series contains Texas Instruments OMAP LCD framebuffer
drivers. This driver is divided into
* main omapfb driver, which handles most common functions across
processor series, like platform driver registration, ioctl handling,
much like fb skeleton.
This driver then gets through the callback based on the
internal/external lcd controller and panel registered to it based on
processor and board. Internal/External LCD controller as per lcd panel
data registration is being done in separate files and so does patches.
Overall this patches contains framebuffer driver for TI OMAP1
(OMAP1510/1610/1710) and OMAP2 (OMAP2420/2430) and external
controllers used in Nokia Internal Tablets (N770/N800).
These drivers were very well tested on OMAP GIT [1] tree from long
time. Most of the code for this driver is written by Imre Deak
<imre.deak@solidboot.com>.
Also CCed to LKML for wider review, and this v2 went through checkpatch.pl and
I have modified the patches to accept most of checkpatch comments.
