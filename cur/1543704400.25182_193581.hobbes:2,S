I'm curious what Bayesian filters you're using.  The filter I use
(bogofilter.sf.net) regularly catches and properly categorizes these
spams.
A good Bayesian spam filter isn't nearly as susceptible to random words as
some people think.  Words that are likely to be spam (along with words that
are frequently "ham") are given _exponentially_ more weight than other
words.  The only way a group of random words is likely to sway the score is
if it happens upon enough "ham" words to outweigh the message's "spam"
words, and there is just as much chance of randomly picking a "spam" word
as there is of randomly finding "ham".  In any case, you'd need random word
blocks _much_ bigger than 5-10k to make it statistically likely of catching
"ham" tokens.

If filters start looking for grammatically correct phrases or sentences,
the spammers will just start pasting in random sections of books or web
pages.  Multi-word and "markov chains" tests will only be helpful if the
filter also does proper weighting of the results.  And, since my filter
works fine today, I'm in no rush to upgrade to a more complex one.
