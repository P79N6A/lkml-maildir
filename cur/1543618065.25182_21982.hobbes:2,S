Hi,
here a small "bug" report with kernel 2.4.18pre4 (also with 2.4.17):
Asus BIOS allows setting of MPS 1.4 and MP Table, if MP Table is 
disabled, the second processor is not recognized (but I suppose that's 
guessable), if both are enabled the kernel boot until it stops with the 
following lines:
[...]
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
Setting 2 in the phys_id_present map
...changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 2...ok
...TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=2 pin2=0
that's basically all I can tell you (Board: Asus A7v266-D, Chipset: AMD 
MPX, Northbridge AMD 762, Southbridge AMD768; Processors: 2x MP1800+, 
memory: Infineon 2x512 PC2100 CL2). Sorry if this does not suffice.
Please CC to me, since I'm not subscribed.
Cheers
Carsten
