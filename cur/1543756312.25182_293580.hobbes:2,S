That's a completely different problem.  The point here is that
the serial driver currently doesn't do anything with the TP560
(no pci_enable_device(), no pci_route_irq(), no nothing).  Then
when setserial comes along and force-feeds the driver with the
IO and IRQ info, there's nothing at that point that does anything
to enable the device or route its interrupt either.
I did raise the idea of adding a pci_route_irq() interface, but
to be honest, I was never convinced of its general usefulness.
I haven't heard of any driver in the tree that requires it,
so it's not clear that it would be accepted even if I (or you)
wrote it.
I think you mentioned a specific PCI interface chip that was
susceptible to the problem; is there a public reference that
would help explicate the situation?
