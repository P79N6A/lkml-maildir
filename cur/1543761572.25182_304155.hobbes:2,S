I had a nightmare about ntp coming in at the "wrong" time resulting in a
deadlock.  Attached locking changes will make me sleep better :)

Type: Defect Fix 
Disposition: Pending
Description:
I was not happy with the locking on this.  Two changes:
1) Turn off irq while setting the clock.
2) Call the timer code only through the timer interface 
   (set a short timer to do it from the ntp call).
