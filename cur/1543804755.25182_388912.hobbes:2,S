I added a "nice aware" version of the throughput bonuses from spa_svr 
and renamed them fairness bonus.  They don't appear to be working :-(
34 is the priority value that ordinary tasks should end up with i.e. if 
they don't look like interactive tasks or CPU hogs.  If they look like 
interactive tasks they should get a lower one via the interactive bonus 
mechanism and if they look like CPU hogs they should get a higher one 
via the same mechanism.  In addition to this tasks will get bonuses if 
they seem to be being treated unfairly i.e. spending too much time on 
run queues waiting for CPU access.
Looking at your numbers the transcode task has the priority that I'd 
expect it to have but tcdecode and dd seem to have had their priorities 
adjusted in the wrong direction.   It's almost like they'd been 
(incorrectly, obviously) identified as CPU hogs :-(.  I'll look into this.

Good.  How do you find the interactive responsiveness with this one?
Thanks for testing
