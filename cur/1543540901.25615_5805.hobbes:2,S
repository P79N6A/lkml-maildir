Yes, except instead of precomputing, you can generate power_table each
time by doing successive multiplications with the power.  You only need
to generate as many entries as digits in the current value.  The
multiplications are trivial if it's a constant power.
Of course 10 is the only significant non-power-of-two base anyway.
I've never tried that algorithm but I would guess it's faster than long
division.
