What do you mean? Atomic ops don't compare to semaphores.
On FRV atomic ops don't disable interrupts; they reserve one of the eight
conditional execution flags at compile time and that flag is cleared by entry
to an exception, thus aborting the write instruction. See:
	Documentation/fujitsu/frv/atomic-ops.txt
I could try and improve the fastpath on the semaphores for FRV - and perhaps
should - but I implemented the semaphores before I'd thought of the clever way
to do atomic ops.
