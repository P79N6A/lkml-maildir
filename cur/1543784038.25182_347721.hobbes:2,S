Subject: 2.6.13: can kill X server but readlink of /proc/<pid>/exe et. al. says EACCES. feature?

While I have access to /proc/<pid>, readlink fails with EACCES on
	/proc/<pid>/exe
	/proc/<pid>/cwd
	/proc/<pid>/root
even when I own <pid> though it runs with a different effective/saved/fs
uid such as the X server. This is a bit uncomfortable and doesn't
seem right.
Or is this to make /proc mounting inside a chroot jail safe?
