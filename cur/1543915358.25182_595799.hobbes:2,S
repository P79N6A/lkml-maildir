 	Question 1 ,  Is this driver module only ?  Say I like all my drivers 
contained in the linux boot image .
 	Question 2 ,  Where can I find a mailing list to subscribe to in order 
to discuss ,  problems ,  success stories , ... ?
 	From the docs it appears to be almost a brease to setup .  I'd greatly 
like to see the driver be built into the kernel .
