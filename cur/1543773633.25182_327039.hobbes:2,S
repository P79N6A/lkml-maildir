Subject: [PATCH] Kexec on panic vmlinux initrd fix

Hi,
This is a minor bug fix in kexec to resolve the problem of loading panic
kernel with initrd. 
Thanks
Vivek 
o Problem: Loading a capture kenrel fails if initrd is also being loaded.
  This has been observed for vmlinux image for kexec on panic case.
o This patch fixes the problem. In segment location and size verification
  logic, minor correction has been done. Segment memory end (mend) should be
  mstart + memsz - 1. This one byte offset was source of failure for initrd
  loading which was being loaded at hole boundary.
