Hi Pete,
I think I see an issue here. Imagine that you boot a system initially with 
one keyboard connected (usb, ps/2, doesn't matter), and after some time 
you connect second USB keyboard (the NumLock is 'on' on the first keyboard 
when you connect the second one).
Without your patch, the NumLock led will be OK on the second keyboard 
immediately. With your patch, the NumLock will be forced to 'off' and it 
will be out of sync with the first keyboard. The leds will get in sync 
later when any change occurs.

I think this is not worth a quirk - when we get it working properly, why 
not do it unconditionally for all keyboards?
