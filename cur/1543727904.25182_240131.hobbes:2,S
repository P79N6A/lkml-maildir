Would be interesting.  Do you have any benchmarks for your code?
However I think we would need to get rid of the M4 first. I don't
think it would be a good idea to add that as kernel build dependency.
Linux kernel assembly normally uses the C preprocessor and modern gas
also has a quite powerful macro facility that is usually good
enough. Any chance to convert the code to one of these?
