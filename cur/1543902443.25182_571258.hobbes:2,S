Yep, this is also a problem for the ACPI variables (in fact not really,
as long as not overlapping like the rtc resource) and probably the
reason why pnpacpi ignores addresses below 0x100?

It's only purpose is to implement the lax option (insure everything
works as before, but show offending drivers which is, as I said, my
favorite default).
Your suggestion is to just enforce the drivers getting cleaned up or
they won't be functional, just offering
acpi_enforce_resources=[no,strict]?
I fear then this patch will be in mm for ever
IMO:
  - Making sure ACPI claimed regions do not interfere with native
    drivers is very important and will get much more important in near 
    future
  - We need a step by step transition to fix up driver specific things
    smoothly. What about an ugly implementation (the lax option with
    IORESOURCE_SHARED code in kernel/resources.c), that gets reverted
    some kernel iterations later when we can be sure nothing sever
    breaks?

But there could be more?
I have an idea how to implement that so that lax option still works as
expected, but this would be even more ugly than IORESOURCE_SHARED (in
fact extend the IORESOURCE_SHARED code in kernel/resource.c):
If e.g. rtc requests ports already requested by an ACPI variable (marked
IORESOURCE_SHARED or whatever), the marked one gets released and rtc
driver is allowed to claim them (with the message: "IO region [rtc]
conflicts with [ACPI KSB0].  Ignoring.., system might run unstable.")
acpi_request_resource() must check for vanishing entries then (should do
so anyways, forgot that...).
I need to think some more about this, maybe I give it a proof-of-concept
and very-ugly implementation try...

Ok, that was because of too low PNP_MAX_PORT value...
Now I get:
5000-50fe : ACPI PMIO
  5000-50bf : pnp 00:07
    5000-5003 : ACPI PM1a_EVT_BLK
    5004-5005 : ACPI PM1a_CNT_BLK
    5008-500b : ACPI PM_TMR
    5020-5023 : ACPI GPE0_BLK
    50b0-50b7 : ACPI GPE1_BLK
  50c0-50df : pnp 00:07
  50e0-50ef : amd756_smbus
Argggggh, normally it should be:
5000-50fe : ACPI PMIO
...
  50c0-50df : pnp 00:07
  50e0-50ff : pnp 00:07       # this one is missing because
                              # it's bigger than the parent
    50e0-50ef : amd756_smbus
this is because:
AML:
    Name (SMBS, 0x50E0)
    Name (SMBL, 0x20)
    ...
    IO (Decode16,             // values get filled below
          0x0000,             // Range Minimum
          0x0000,             // Range Maximum
          0x00,               // Alignment
          0x00,               // Length
    _Y0D)
    ...
    If (SMBS)
    {
           CreateWordField (CRS, \_SB.PCI0.SBRG.RMSC._Y0E._MIN, GP10)
           CreateWordField (CRS, \_SB.PCI0.SBRG.RMSC._Y0E._MAX, GP11)
           CreateByteField (CRS, \_SB.PCI0.SBRG.RMSC._Y0E._LEN, GP1L)
           Store (SMBS, GP10)
           Store (SMBS, GP11)
           Store (SMBL, GP1L)
    }
that means this pnp region (filled with SMBS and SMBL values)
(0x50e0-0x50ff, starting at 0x50e0 and length of 0x20) inside the pnp
device is one byte longer than the one claimed by the ACPI variable PMIO
(0x5000-0x50fe) -> partially overlapping -> cannot be added as a child.
If this should work at all it must be possible to add pnpacpi devices to
an ACPI variable, even it exceeds the variable's border...
(Or the first machine I used has a buggy DSDT table :) ).
If this patch gets extended to allow the overlapping of ACPI SystemIO
Operation Regions and ACPI resource declarations (which would make the
code even more ugly, but I think this should be done), it still had the
functionality to identify native driver interference and all could work
as intended... But, if there is an ACPI kernel driver serving the ACPI
device (and it should be allowed to access its resources...), it's not
possible to ensure this one does not access the same resources than some
arbitrary executed AML code at the same time (this can only be ensured
if ACPI spec forbids that device resources and OperationRegion
declarations can overlap...).

Yep, but a temporary solution where everything just works fine and a
message: "This driver needs fixing" is needed IMO (if the code gets
accepted... It's possible, but ...).
