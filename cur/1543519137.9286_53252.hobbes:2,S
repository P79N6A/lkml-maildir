I don't want to bug the list, but I wanted to confirm
that Pete's patch (see below) is indeed required to fix accept()
in 2.3.32-pre4
The patch that Pete provided fixed earlier versions of the kernel
so that the perl test script t/lib/io/unix.t would pass, as
unpatched kernels don't block in accept as documented
I'm hoping it get's into the official 2.3.32 release.
