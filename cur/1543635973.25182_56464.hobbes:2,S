my test app uses pthreads (one thread per disk-worker) and 
pthread_cond_wait in the master task to wait for all workers to finish.
i'll switch the app to use clone() and sys_futex instead.
i guess in that case, its debatable whether its a kernel problem or not -- 
pthreads is out there, and if its default behavior is bad, any threaded app 
which uses it will also be bad.
cheers,
lincoln.
