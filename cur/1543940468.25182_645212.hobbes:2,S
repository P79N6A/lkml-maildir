Wrong way. They are inside #ifndef __KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES, so
they _are_ available to userspace.

grep aligned_u64 include/linux/netfilter{,ipv4,ipv6}/*.h
iptables uses that, but we can get rid of it if need be.
It just throws up 3 lines anyway, ...

... so could use __attribute__((aligned(8))) directly for exported
headers, like we currently do for pointers (since there is no
alignedptr_64 or so).
