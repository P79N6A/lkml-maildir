Please give me a realistic and non-broken example.
We can add lots of stuff to the kernel, because it _might_ be needed, but 
we (usually) don't if it hurts the general case, just adds bloat and 
userspace can achieve the same thing via different means.

That doesn't mean it has to be exported via every single kernel API, which 
allows to specify a time.

No, it's not doing this at the validation point.

Sorry, but I don't get what you're talking about. What has the user space 
concept of time to do with how the kernel finally handles a timeout?
More specifically why does the first require a new API in the kernel to 
deal with all kinds of timeouts?
