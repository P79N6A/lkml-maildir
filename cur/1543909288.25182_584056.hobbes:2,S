You said that ZONE_DMA will still be there right? So the zone will be 
replicated over all nodes but remain unused except for node 0.

IA64 also uses ZONE_DMA to support 32bit controllers. 
So I think we can only get rid of ZONE_DMA in its 16MB incarnation for 
i386 and x86_64.
But you will be keeping ZONE_DMA32?
If so then it may be better to drop ZONE_DMA32 and make ZONE_DMA be below 
4GB like other 64bit arches.
