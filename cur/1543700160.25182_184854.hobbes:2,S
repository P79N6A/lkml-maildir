Hi folks,
I have a linux box with three NICs (two for external ISP, and one local).
Today I tried to use 2.6.0 kernel and something is wrong, because iproute2
does not work corretly.
No routed packets go via second ISP NIC which I use with iproute rules. With
2.4.22 kernel I have no problems at all with packet routing.
I compiled 2.6.0 kernel myself, maybe I missed something in .config file?
Thanks
Remus
