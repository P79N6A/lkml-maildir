Subject: Kernel Compiling using "make rpm" question PLEASE!!

I would not be asking this question but I have to say someone maybe even 
myself will have to make a DOC on this cause there are none!!!! 
The convention method for configuring, compiling and installing a kernel I 
am very clear on but why cannot find any documents on how to compile it 
using "make rpm" or recompile or "rpmbuild -bb" 
I have searched the bookstores, www.redhat.com, www.tldp, most newgroups and 
almost every single search result from www.google.com/linux. 
Conventional Method: 
tar -zxvf kernel.xx  or rpm -ivh kernel-source.i386.rpm
ln -s kernel.xx linux
make clean
make mrproper
make menuconfig
make dep
make clean
make bzImage
make modules
make modules_install
make install
mkinitrd 
 
RPM METHOD: 
tar -zxvf kernel.xx  or rpm -ivh kernel-source.i386.rpm
ln -s kernel.xx linux  # I think this step may be need if you have a rpm 
kernel source!! 
make clean
make mrproper
make menuconfig
make rpm
rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/kernel-xx.i386.rpm
mkinitrd 
 
Just currious as to why I cannot find something as simple as that for "make 
rpm" 
Still trying to figure out how to use "rpmbuild -bb"
