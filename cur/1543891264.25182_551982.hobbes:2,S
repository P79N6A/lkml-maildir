This is obviously correct, although at the time those interfaces were
designed, I don't believe either pread/pwrite nor sendfile() existed,
and they still couldn't wait on real files.  That there isn't a suitable
way to wait for a file at an offset is probably a result of that past
history.
Waiting at f_pos is still a possible interface, of course; it would mean
that pread/pwrite/sendfile users would have to seek before waiting.
However, implementing waiting on files in select/poll is prohibited by
POSIX, so it would at least need some sort of Linux-specific flag anyway.
It seems that being able to do nonblocking I/O on files would be a
useful thing.  This really *does* require proper nonblocking I/O and not
just the ability to wait, since you can never know when the kernel
decides to recycle the page you are just about to want from the cache.

(b) seems really ugly.  (a) is at least well-defined.  Either seems
wrong, though.
