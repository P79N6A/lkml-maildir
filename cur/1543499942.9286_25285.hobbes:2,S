I've chased some down to two things
1.	Poor device drivers - especially ISA ones on 2.2 not dropping locks		Also intentionally bad drivers (IDE transfers without -u1 set etc)
2.	Some socket7 chipsets dont seem to default to any kind of sane fair
	sharing on PCI, a big UDMA IDE transfer stalls the CPU for ages, also
	on some the CPU<->PCI transfers always beat busmastering PCI cards
	meaning big graphics blits cause sound dropouts.
I asked for a quick config check  - neither seem to be the case for this user.
