gcc does smart things including deferring stack cleanup so that it can
turn
	push, push, call, adjust stack, push, push call .. etc
into a sequence with less stack pointer adjustment for performance
reasons. That sometimes fools the traceback code. A good rule of thumb
is to trace the sequence of calls and assume that the last sane sequence
is the one that occurred before the failure.
