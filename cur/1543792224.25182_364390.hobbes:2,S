Steven,
  Hi . I run my ATI PCI_Express card on a 64-bit kernel. (2.6.14-rt6)
It works fine for my needs, although as I said earlier my glxgears
numbers are nothing to shout about:
0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV370
5B60 [Radeon X300 (PCIE)]
0000:01:00.1 Display controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV370 [Radeon X300SE]
mark@lightning ~ $ glxgears
Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
3170 frames in 5.0 seconds = 634.000 FPS
3416 frames in 5.0 seconds = 683.200 FPS
3294 frames in 5.0 seconds = 658.800 FPS

   I'm using the radeon driver from the Xorg-X11 package. The only
problem I've run into which remains unsolved is that when I run either
Quicken or IE6 under Crossover Office 5.0 all of the icons in those
windows programs show up in black and white, not color, so they are
somewhat unreadable. Other than that no real problems.
