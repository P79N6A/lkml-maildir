> I reported this bug before for 2.4.3 and a patch which fixed (or worked around) this problem was posted. The patch still works for 2.4.4
The fixup is bogus. Im not sure who wrote it or why. Its not the right fix for
the VIA later chip bugs. Its not the right way to do a two chip combination
fixup if that was really needed.
Deleting it seems sensible
