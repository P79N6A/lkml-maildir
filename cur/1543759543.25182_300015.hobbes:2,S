(afaik) these are not critical - they come from the yout acpi bios.
these implementions are known to be bad. you can find more information
on the acpi homepage[1]. maybe you can fix this with a modifcated dsdt
from there - but i'm not sure if it's worth the work.
do you get valid entries in /proc/acpi and are your battery states ok?
then you most likely have no problem. on my old libretto i get tons of
them at bootup and sometimes when comming out of suspend.
however, if your logs get filled with those messages ... 
sl ritch.
