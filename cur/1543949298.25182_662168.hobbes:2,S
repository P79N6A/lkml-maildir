Surely a unit with one defective block and a squillion good blocks is
faulty.  Sure it is.  It has a fault, which is what it means to be
faulty.  Spread the wear of that one block over all squillion and one
blocks and you get a much longer lifetime.  It seems intuitive that
distributing wear significantly increases time to failure.
