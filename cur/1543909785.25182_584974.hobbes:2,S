Except for the fact that on most systems each owner may have millions of
files, while very rarely does a file have more than a few dozen owners
or groups.  Having to wade through the permissions of millions of things
seems like a lot more work than checking a few dozen things.
Also the thing is that I care who can access files, while I do not
really care what particular set of files a user has access to.  It is
the data I am protecting, not the user.
