I think Alan's point is that you are then stuck with the usb stuff loaded
even if nothing's using it.  Usb is kind of a special case though, I
guess.
I can now see the problem with post-install rules, but I still find magic
module aliases icky.  One thing that crossed my mind was to make rmmod -a
a bit smarter: if it notices that a module that sits above another (i.e.
specified with the 'above' keyword in modules.conf) disappears, it could
try to remove the lower module.
But then that requires that everyone move to a version of modutils that
(a) supports the 'above' keyword and (b) is smart about removing modules
like that.
*sigh* I'm wondering what scheme parport should use -- it _was_ using
parport_lowlevel, but that didn't seem to fit in any more once we added
the register_driver port notification callbacks. (It still actually will
work, it will just warn loudly.)
Tim.
