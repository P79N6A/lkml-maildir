Improvements on this man page (or any man page) are always welcome.
[OT]
Yesterday, or this morning or so, man-pages-1.54.tar.gz was released.
(E.g. at 
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/manpages/
 )
A new page is tty_ioctl.4.
Maybe some people would like to check details, point out undocumented
tty ioctls, or add fragments.
Of course, we need many more pages foo_ioctl.4.
