Cool.  If nothing else, this is a much better starting point for further work 
than starting from scratch...

There's at least three seperate things that need testing here.  memtest86 
tests whether your memory is OK.  CPUburn seems to do a good job testing 
processor heat (not that I'm running it on my laptop, which doesn't seem to 
have a thermal readout thingy anyway...)
The third thing (which started this thread) was memory bus.  The new 3DNow 
optimizations drove a memory bus into failure, and that IS processor 
specific...

The downside of a test like gcc is that it does test many things, meaning 
when it fails you still don't know why.
memtest86 is great becuase it ONLY tests memory.  CPUburn is similarly 
specific.  A memory bus buster would be a good tool to add to the mix.  (DMA 
is another common problem, but the more I look into it, the more it seems to 
be dependent on whatever peripheral you're talking to, which is more 
complication than I'm looking to bite off...)
The downside of memtest86 is that your system can pass it and still have an 
obvious problem (for example, overclocking stresses both memory bus AND 
heat...)
It might be possible to put all three testers into a menu where you could 
switch on and off what you wanted to test, and run them overnight.  That way, 
if you are testing for three things (perhaps alternating tests every few 
minutes?), and you get it to fail, you can switch some off to get more 
specific tests to narrow down the problem...

I've heard of ceberus but thought it was just a disk test suite...  One more 
thing to download and look into...  (If the tests in it can be switched 
on/off, maybe this is what I'm looking for...)
