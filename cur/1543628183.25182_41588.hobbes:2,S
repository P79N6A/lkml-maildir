That is completely different. Linus owns the Linux kernel. He is the 
dictator on what happens with it. As such he can do with it as he pleases. 
If anyone doesn't like his actions, they are free to fork the kernel and do 
whatever they want. That is what the GPL is all about!
This thread is getting sillier and sillier...
