Hi,
2.4.13-ac will "flushing ide drives" on shutdown. This helped my laptop
from not '/dev/hdax no cleanly unmounted, checking' on startup. I'm sure
the system did not crash before that.
2.4.15-pre6 does not have this code and now sometimes some filesystems
seem not to be clean anymore on startup...
Will the ide_notify_reboot be included in 2.4.15 final?
-Marcel
