Well if userspace is writing to the filesystem metadata via the
blockdevice while it is running... that's the definition of havoc,
isn't it? ;) Whether or not the writes are going via a unified
metadata/blockdev cache or separate ones.
You really just have to not do that.
The actual reiserfs problem being seen is not because of userspace
going silly, but because ramdisk is hijacking the dirty bits.

No, it wouldn't. Because if you're proposing to split up the buffer
cache and the metadata cache, then you're back to a 2 cache
solution which is basically has the memory characteristics of my
proposal while still being horribly incestuous with the pagecache.

Well its needed because some filesystems forget about their old
metadata. It's not really there to solve aliasing with the blockdev
pagecache.

Although this is going off the track of the ramdisk problem. For
that we should just do the rewrite.
