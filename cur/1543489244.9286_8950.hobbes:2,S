I wouldn't like to be an admin whose daemons die because some luser has a
memory leak in his program. :) (note that only browsing with netscape
crashed my computer few times because of java applets alocating more &
more memory)
Anyway, if the user takes less memory than
((amount of memory+swap)/number of active users), his processes won't get
killed. And if he allocates more, he does it at his own risk.

In many cases allocation fails, but sometimes the process could get SIGBUS
or something like it. But it makes no difference - programs die if they
can't allocate memory; "better" programs write something like "out of
memory, terminating", worse programs work with NULL pointer and crash on
SIGSEGV.
