Thanks! Based on my CVS history, it looks like this was broken in 2002
when the access command was moved from another function and verification
of -ETIMEDOUT value was not moved correctly. The original behavior would
be achieved by changing your patch to call printk first before the moved
prism2_hw_reset(dev) call. I added this (with the re-ordered printk) to
my queue for wireless-2.6.
