I have an idea why this is going on.  Packets are pre-allocated by the 
driver to be a max packet size, so when you send small packets, it 
wastes a lot of memory.  Currently Linux uses the packets at the 
beginning of a connection to make a guess at how best to advertise its 
window so as not to overflow the socket's memory bounds.  Since you 
start out with big segments then go to small ones, this is defeating 
that mechanism.  It's actually documented in the comments in 
tcp_input.c. :)

If you overflow the socket's memory bound, it ends up calling 
tcp_clamp_window().  (I'm not sure this is really the right thing to do 
here before trying to collapse the queue.)  If the receiving 
application doesn't fall too far behind, it might help you to set a 
much larger receiver buffer.
