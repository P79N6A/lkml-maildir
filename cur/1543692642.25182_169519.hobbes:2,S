Then we should fix the broken headers so that it is guaranteed.
That's quite trivial, isn't it?
I don't really understand why it's that important to duplicate
definitions from kernel headers in libc ones.
IMHO glibc headers should include kernel headers instead of defining
things which are already defined by the kernel and used on kernel-user
interface.
Duplicate definitions should IMHO be removed from glibc headers.
