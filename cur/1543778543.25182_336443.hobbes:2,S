Someone should also fix the home page of kernel.org. Since there's no
link on that page that points to the full 2.6.12. Since a lot of the
patches on that page go directly against the 2.6.12 kernel and not
2.6.12.3, it would be nice to get the full source of that kernel from
the home page.
If I want to incremently build the 2.6.13-rc3-mm1, would I need to
download the 2.6.12 tar ball, followed by the 2.6.13-rc3 patch and then
the 2.6.13-rc3-mm1 patch and apply them that way?  If so, I can get all
the patches but the starting point.  Yes I could also download the full
version of any of these, but it still seems to make sense to include the
starting point of the patches on the home page.
Just a thought,
