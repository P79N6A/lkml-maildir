This bug was only introduced in 2.6.19, due to a change that caused pte
dirty bits to be discarded without a subsequent set_page_dirty() (nowhere
else in the kernel should have done this).
So if your corruption is years old, then it must be something else.
Maybe it is hidden by a timing change, or BDB isn't using msync properly.
