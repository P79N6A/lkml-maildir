The argument is just an integer; I'm not sure that marking it const actually
achieves anything, except to tell the function that it can't modify it - and
since it's effectively a copy, where's the fun in that.

Ah.  I thought that was just for supporting old versions of gcc.  I didn't
realise it was for handling strange compilers.
