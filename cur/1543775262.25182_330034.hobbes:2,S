Right, the question really is can we do anything with it, so targets
have properties (as do devices) but currently we have no channel
properties.
All SCSI devices have "ports" as defined by SAM; however, we don't show
them (well, except FC rports) because we don't use them for anything.
As far at least as SAS expanders go, I believe they do have properties
(the routing table etc.) which the driver can query, so they might be
worth adding a device for.

The latter (that's the devices tree under /sys/devices).
