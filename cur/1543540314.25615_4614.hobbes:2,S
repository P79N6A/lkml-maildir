You may want to have a look at the atime/diratime mount options, or
even chattr -A to prevent certain files causing a write when they're
run/read.
Note that just executing "sync" causes its atime to be marked for update,
which will cause a write back to disk a short while later.
What I tend to do is to partition my system in such a way that / and /usr
can be mounted noatime (ie, all programs), /home is without any extra
options, and /var with nodiratime.  Eg:
	/dev/hda3 on / type ext2 (rw,noatime)
	proc on /proc type proc (rw)
	/dev/hda4 on /usr type ext2 (rw,noatime)
	/dev/hda5 on /var type ext2 (rw,nodiratime)
	/dev/hda8 on /home type ext2 (rw)
Oh, I also set sshd to recreate its keys every 6 hours, and modify cron
so it doesn't log to file (there doesn't seem to be a command line option
for this).
With all this, I can get my machines (setup the way I have them) to run
for up to 6 hours without spinning up the drives (ie, over night).  Oh,
the other thing is that I have set the standby timer on the hard drive
(hdparm -S) to be 10 minutes, which means its not spinning down during
my normal use.
Note that if you run stuff like xntpd, or squid, then it gets harder,
but its still possible to achieve.
