 Using a private workqueue fixes the issue, sleeping for many seconds
 from the common workqueue was not nice.
 Note that the problem only happens when appropriate firmware hotplug
 support is not available and request_firmware_work_func() has to wait
 until the timeout.
 About the attached patch:
 	- use a private workqueue so we can sleep without interfering
	  with other subsystems.
 Have a nice day
