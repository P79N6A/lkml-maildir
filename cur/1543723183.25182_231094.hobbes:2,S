OK, the last time I was messing around the
mremap, it was mapping the anonymous pages
to me when I was trying to expand the /dev/mem
mapping (missing nopage handler apparently,
having the failure could be much better in that
case I think).

Yes, as for SIGBUS - now I see why it works that
way (not necessary accept its correctness, but
what you said, sounds perfectly valid to me, so
the complete retirement on my side:)

... and/or expand the anonymous private mapping without
the truncation (nothing to truncate). So yes, after all,
it was specific to the anon-shm, which is a special case.
And introducing the per-vma mremap handlers to fix only
this special case (by doing the truncation immediately)
is an overkill and is not required by anyone except myself.
And this:
---
In most 
cases (at least for the malloc case) this will be a anonymous mapping, 
but it's by no means an error to extend any mapping you have created.
---
may just mean that it is never an error, but you have
to deal with the consequences yourself if you expanded
only the mapping and not the object (except for the
case of anon-shm, where you can't deal with the
consequences anyhow since you can't expand the object).
Have I got everything properly this time, or failed the
homework agan? :)
