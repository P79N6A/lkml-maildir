It CAN be, if you WANT it to. (/proc/sys/vm/overcommit). I don't have this
enabled, though, and I haven't changed this setting.

Something grabbed all the memory. Just running while(1){malloc(4096);}
will do this quite easily, unless you have process rlimits set to stop
that, in which case it is harder to demonstrate.

It doesn't literally copy it all, though - it just marks it COW.
Otherwise, you would never be able to run a real WWW site with Apache, for
example - the memory demands would just be impossible to meet.

Yes - what I meant is that we don't REALLY copy it all at fork() time -
that would be very inefficient. We only "pretend" to, via COW.

Yes - in practice, we really need the latter, though.

Unless you have specifically enabled this, malloc() shouldn't be
overcommitted - you call malloc() and get some memory, and it's yours.
It's only things like fork(), where you only have "fake" memory (it's
really shared with someone else until you write to it), that overcommit
takes effect otherwise.
