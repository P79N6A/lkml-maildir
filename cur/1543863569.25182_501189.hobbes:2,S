I agree that the patch allowing device_move(dev, NULL) is non-trivial,
but the one removing the useless device_is_registered() check should be
straightforward enough.

If removing the device_is_registered() check helps you, I'd lobby for
the inclusion of that part (and leave device_move(dev, NULL) for
post-2.6.20). (It should help for devices with no bus; for my use case,
everything worked fine.)
