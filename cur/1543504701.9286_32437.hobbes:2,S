Excellent. I was -><- this close to doing the same thing last week. Now can we 
alter the build system to automatically call in new directory trees if they 
have an appropriate Makefile and Config.in in them?
This way, we can distribute subsystems (drivers/fieldbus, drivers/pcmcia, 
drivers/mtd, drivers/alsa, whatever) separately from the kernel, without 
having to apply a patch to the main tree at all - just drop the new directory 
in place.
Linus, if I do this cleanly, will you accept it?
