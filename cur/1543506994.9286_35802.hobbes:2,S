i really don't want to pull on that chain!  if people agree on a new
precedent, i'll be happy to follow it.

right -- i didn't expect that the user-level headers would include any
kernel headers.  they will likely have duplicate definitions of the MADV
macros, just like everything else.

i agree, but i'm not sure madvise is the place to start. it would be
confusing to have madvise work that way, but nothing else.  in other
words, what you are proposing seems like a bigger project that i don't
want madvise to get stuck behind, if you know what i mean.  on the other
hand, i'm not familiar with how new system call stuff gets added to glibc
and user-level headers, so it may not be difficult at all.
