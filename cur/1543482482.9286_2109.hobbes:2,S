Subject: 2.2.0 problem inode related?

After running 2.2.0 for about 10 hours I managed to exceed my disk quota
after downloading 5M of files.  I have a 2GIG quota and I was only using
about 800M before booting 2.2.0!
Given that I did not have this problem with 2.2.0-pre[1-9] _AND_ I know
there was changes to inode.c for 2.2.0.  My money says it's inode
related, but frankly I can't tell from the source.  Given that du agreed
with the quota command I doubt the problem is quota related.
I recorded the output of du under 2.2.0 to a file and then rebooted into
pre9.  I then compared the two files to try and determine what *MIGHT*
have gone wrong.  Here are the differences:
4       ./build/alsa/alsa-driver/lowlevel/isa/CVS
w4      ./build/alsa/alsa-driver/lowlevel/isa/CVS
98      ./build/procps-990103/proc
a98     ./build/procps-990103/proc
86      ./build/procps-990103/xproc
s86     ./build/procps-990103/xproc
884908  .
2383543 .
Now I had to tweak these files some, and it's quite possible a stray
finger in vi insert the 's' 'a' and 'w' characters above, but I don't
think so.  I really think they came straight out of du. (They were most
definately not on adjacent lines. or a seperate fixed interval.)  One
thing is for certain, the block totals were *WAY* different.
Also, for what it's worth, I have a second 2.2.0 box NFS mounting the
same directory.  I do get correct values out of du on that box when the
directory is being served from pre9.  ( I don't know enough about the
NFS code to know if this is signifigant or not. )
I have been using the same kernel config since about pre3. It is
attached below.
