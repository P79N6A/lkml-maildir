5% seems a bit much for many people and they'd rather like to see 0%,
but given that we need to make progress, it could be tuned to ~1%.
Note that whenever the compiler will need to wait for the disk (page in
binary code, swapping, reading headers), the nice process will get to
run, so in practice the compiler does lose less than it seems at first
sight. If the nice process weren't, you'd see a certain percentage of
I/O wait ...
