Oh yes, I know about that, but didn't remember it when I posted.

This is the specific thing I was talking about.  Even if the drive can power
down with a command, it doesn't wait for a command to perform the spinup
when power is applied, and that's what's missing.
It seems like there is already protocol support in IDE, so the drive just
needs a way to be configured...  Maybe some drives will allow software
config of this when they implement it?
