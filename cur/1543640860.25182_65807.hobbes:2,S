Yes you can. Spinlocks will be compiled in if you choose SMP even on single processor machine.
But look at the documentation in the kernel source.
I think "lock" in your message is a semaphore in real life.
Spinlocks never sleep - they don't perform task switch and you can use them anywhere, while semaphores
can sleep and you can use them only in user context (not in interrupt or bottom half)
