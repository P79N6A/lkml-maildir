Well, I think it does, but not because it itself is generating much of
a load.  I had it block traffic on my desktop machine while doing a
kernel compile; I run with high parallelism and the load occationally
spikes in the high 20's.  However, the machine is perfectly
responsive, and so I was a little taken back by this.
The way Linux computes the load average really does call for higher
limits than what BSD does.  This isn't inherently a "good" or "bad"
thing -- it's just a fact of life.  That being said, it probably would
be useful if the Sendmail people would provide higher default limits
in cf/ostype/linux.m4 than for other systems.
The one thing about load average that is making it a bit hard to deal
with is that workloads on modern machines tend to vary a little too
quickly for the standard load average time constants to deal well with
them.  It's probably fine for throttling down a machine that is
getting killed with requests, but not really enough to keep, say,
parallel make without a limit ("make -j" as opposed to "make -j5")
from forking the machine to the point where the make itself fails
before knowing what just hit it.
