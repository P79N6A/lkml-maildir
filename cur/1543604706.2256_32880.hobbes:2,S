I just hacked something quickly together so that people can test what
impact different hash tables sizes have on their workload, and for
that using the order was easiest. The goal is of course to do
automatic hash table tuning. I don't expect it to be an permanent
tunable. My hope is that it'll turn out that smaller hash tables will
be good enough.
