Ah, of course.  I followed the instructions that came with the
module-init-tools, and then just used "make modules_install".  
So much for following instructions.
I can only make the general observation that it would be helpful if:
- module-init-tools documentation pointed out this drawback of
installing to /usr/local/sbin
- module-init-tools documentation stated if it is or is not backward
compatible for the 2.4 kernels  (is it?)
- The kernel makefile used the module tools under /usr/local/sbin if
they exist.
(sigh)
Anyway, thanks again for the advice.
