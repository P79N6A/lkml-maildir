We should hardly check for all race conditions. It is likely to cause
some random troubles at both V4L and DVB sides. 
For example, on V4L side, this may produce weird stuff like bad device
number associations (for example, the same device might get /dev/video0
and /dev/radio1, but apps expects to have the same numbering for
both)...
The same on DVB: demux0 should be associated with frontend0, for DVB to
work properly, but, with simultaneous probing, this might not happen.
For sure some newer locks will be required for multithread probe.
