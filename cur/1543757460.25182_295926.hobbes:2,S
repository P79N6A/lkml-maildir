I want it so I can grow Xen guests after they have been booted
up.  Being able to hot-add memory is essential for dynamically
resizing the memory of various guest OSes, to readjust them for
the workload.
Memory hot-remove isn't really needed with Xen, the balloon
driver takes care of that.

I'm interested.  I want to get this stuff working with Xen ;)
