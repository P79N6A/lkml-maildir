Subject: something terribly rotten with scheduler?

Scenario:
- linux 2.2.10 on an dual SMP intel machine (gcc-2.7.2.3, no patches)
- crack in network mode (i.e. two processes with high
  user load):
  000     0   614     1  20  19  1836 1188 -      RN   ?        117:21 cracker -kill run/RK1-localhost -from 127 -nice 20
  000     0   692     1  19  19  1528  880 -      RN   ?        117:14 cracker -kill run/RK2-localhost -from 127 -nice 20
  As you can see, they are niced. No problem, usually.
- X-server runs in real time priority, if that is a concern
Now _sometimes_  (rarely), other processes hang. Like this:
    0  9352 0000000000000102 0000000000000000 0000000080000000 0000000000000000 D    ttyp7      0:00 xv -nodecor pgcc.png
As you can see from the pending signals mask (102) kill -9 was not very
effective in killing it. However, a "killall -STOP cracker" _immediately_
released the locked processes. How can that be? How can two nice 20
processes totally block normal processes?
BTW, this only happened with 2.2.10, but I didn't run crack for a long
time so it might not be version dependent.
