Hi...
I am using such a vga/monochrom hercules card combination.
It does work but :
My vga-console size is 132x60.
Since the hercules card is not able to do this (well infact i've seen 80x50
on such cards, with SoftIce for WinNT) the console driver only displays a
part of the screen (left top 80x25 rectangle).
All the syslog is going through such a MDA-Console. Therefore it looks very
'cut' :(
I am really not sure what to do about it. Maybe you know.
Thanks a lot,
Soeren.
