Sure, we *could* have done that.  We chose not to because some of the user space
programs were having problems during bootup times.  Instead, we did it in the
kernel for our specific application as that was the better place where we had
more control (for *our* application).

Yes, Alan mentions the same thing.
We didn't realize that was the long term plan.  Is that documented anywhere, or
was it discussed on this list eons ago and 'decided'? ;)
