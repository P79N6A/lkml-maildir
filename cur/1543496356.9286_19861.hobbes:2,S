  The time limits will be there only once.. I just separated them to other structure as I'd like
to have first header completely implementation independent.. There are also times in quota_block -
they have to be there as they identify time, when soft quota changes into hard quota.

  We won't write 1GB of data. We take advantage of sparse files so there is almost no
difference between storage of UIDS 1000, 1010 and 1000, 10000...
