I don't think so.  All machines in all memory models can and do have holes
in their memory map.  I think the problem is that some machines object to
having those holes read from and others do not.  It could be that this
problem is purely an ia64 thing.
And it's not just holes: we had a problem a year or so back where CPU
prefetching was walking off the end of real mmeory and into the AGP region
and was causing weird cache coherency problems on x86_64 (or something like
that).

Well the CCISS driver presently has no architecture Kconfig dependencies,
so anyone can build it on anything.  I don't know whether it's physically
possible to put a cciss controller into a power/sparc/whatever machine -
are these controllers only ever integrated onto the main boad?
Anyway, I'd suggest the best way of sorting this out is to come up with a
complete description of the problem, decide which architectures are
affected and to then ask the relevant architecture maintainers to recommend
a solution.
I think the description would be
  There is a bug in the DMA engine that that may result in prefetching
  data from beyond the end of memory or falling off into one the holes on
  IPF and AMD.  It causes a machine check when that happens.
  It doesn't happen on Proliant because the last 4kB (or so) of memory is
  mapped out by the BIOS and Pentium guarantees contiguous memory.
  If the platform is culnerable to this then driver's prefetching needs
  to be disabled at compile-time or, preferably, initialization-time.  What
  is the best means by which we can determine whether the platform needs
  this treatment?
(the patch didn't compile, btw: there's no definition of I2O0_DMA1_CFG)
