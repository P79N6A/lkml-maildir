I have looked further into this, but it seemes intentional, if you look at the 
comment in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c of 2.4.20-rc4 it says:
If the user specifies memory size, we limit the BIOS-provided memory map to 
that size. exactmap can be used to specify the exact map. mem=number can be 
used to trim the existing memory map.
The comment in 2.4.18 was: If the user specifies memory size, we blow away any 
automatically generated size.
If you still think it's a bug, let me know and I'll report it in a seperate 
mail.
