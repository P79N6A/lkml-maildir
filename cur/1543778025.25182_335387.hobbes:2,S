 Yeah - I don't really consider the current CPU controller code something
 ready for consideration yet for mainline merging.  That doesn't mean
 we don't want a CPU controller for CKRM - just that what we have
 doesn't integrate cleanly/nicely with mainline.

 I don't know what bugs you are referring to here.  I don't think we
 have any open defects with SuSE on the CPU scheduler in their releases.
 And that is not at all related to the reason for not having a CPU
 controller in the current patch set.
