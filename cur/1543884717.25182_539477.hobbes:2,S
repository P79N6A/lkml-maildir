I guess DFS referrals can work cross protocol, so if you are redirected
from a longhorn server to a windoes 2000 or a samba server you want to
be able to follow the DFS referral and not return an error.
To do that you need to have either 1 module that support both protocols
or a way from one module to call the other. Just separating the 2
without any glue will not work (or you will have to add some userspace
upcall hack to make it work).
Simo.
