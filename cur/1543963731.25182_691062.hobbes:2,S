Hmmm, I rechecked the files used 'phys_cpu_present_map'.
$ grep -nr "mpspec.h" arch/x86/ | cut -d: -f 1 | xargs grep "phys_cpu_present_map" | cut -d: -f 1 | uniq
arch/x86/kernel/setup.c
arch/x86/kernel/apic_64.c
arch/x86/kernel/apic_32.c
And in Makefile:
obj-$(CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC)    += apic_$(BITS).o nmi_$(BITS).o
So your patch looks correct!
Thanks.
