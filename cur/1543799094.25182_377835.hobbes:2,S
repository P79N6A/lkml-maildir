For a database, it's also helpful to know when an operation is going
to block on I/O (i.e. because the data isn't cached, or write buffers
full) and if that's going to happen, move it to another thread, or
move other operations to another thread.  This allows a program to
continue to work on other things concurrently with I/O more
effectively than thread pool guesswork.
So if you add these new syscalls, it would be helpful to add a "flags"
argument to each of them, and define one flag: "don't block on I/O".
When the flag is set, the syscalls should do as much reading or
writing as they can without blocking, and then return the count, or
EAGAIN.
(FreeBSD's sendfile() has an SF_NODISKIO flag which means this, and it
is used in exactly that way: so a program can move the sendfile() to
another thread iff that is necessary to avoid blocking the program.)
There's also a case for making these into async I/O operations.
However, if there is any possibility of async I/O blocking a task for
a long time (which there is with Linux async I/O apparently), that is
not half as useful as a flag to stop I/O when it would block, and let
the program decide what to do.
I mention this precisely because it's relevant to I/O performance of
databases and similar programs, and therefore a reason to have a
"flags" argument to these new syscalls, even if no flags are defined
at first.
