To clarify:
- SELinux kernel access controls are configured by policy to ensure that
only approved tools can manipulate the file (based on inode attribute,
initially established at install time),
- SELinux kernel labeling mechanism for new inodes is configured by
policy to ensure that new files created by such tools are labeled with
the most restrictive label (i.e. the one for shadow, not passwd data) by
default, so that we don't leak information accidentally,
- Approved tools/libraries are instrumented to specify the desired label
for passwd vs. shadow (and backup files), since the same code re-creates
both on a transaction (at least when adding/removing users), so the
kernel can't make that distinction automatically; only the tool knows
that.  This is consistent with how DAC mode is handled for passwd vs.
shadow. 
No pathname-based mechanism in the kernel required, or desired.  Names
are meaningless to real security properties.
