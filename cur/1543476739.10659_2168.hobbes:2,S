There is a link error (with 2.2.0pre6 and probably other versions) when
selecting both tulip and 3c59x (CONFIG_DEC_ELCP and CONFIG_VORTEX):
...
        --end-group \
        -o vmlinux
drivers/net/net.a(tulip.o)(.data+0x6c): multiple definition of `kernel_version'
drivers/net/net.a(3c59x.o)(.data+0x18): first defined here
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
The kernel_version symbol also appears in smc9194.c.
