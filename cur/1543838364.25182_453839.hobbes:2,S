ITYM performance vs. slightly different patch.  Let me put all pieces
in one place:
	* kstat gets u64 ino
	* filesystems that want to report 64bit st_ino do it in their
->getattr(); the rest is unchanged.
	* ino_t is left as-is
	* filldir() callbacks get u64 ino in arguments.  Filesystem may
pass 64bit value if it cares to; otherwise it's left unchanged.
	* filesystem that wants unusual search key can use iget5() (as
it can do right now)
	* filesystem that wants to use the values it'd put into st_ino in
its printks should use appropriate format
	* any printk in generic code that happens to use i_ino should
be hunted down and shot for utter uselessness for too many filesystems
(not sure if we actually _have_ any such printk these days).
