Nah, why do you think it will screw up the eeprom?
Did you try to completely power off the machine before rebooting
into windows?
I _really_ _really_ _really_ think that there is no chance of writing
the eeprom by accident. It is protected by some write-enable bit in
PCI config space. There is only one place where we enable that bit
and where we actually _write_ to the eeprom shadow mmio space. That's
the eeprom writing code. It will output _lots_ of kernelmessages that
you really can't miss when that happens. And it's only called on behalf
of a private ioctl user request. _And_ it verifies the data with a CRC
check. So you really can't call it by accident.
But prove me wrong and show the code that writes to eeprom. :)

Are you suggesting that bcm43xx people don't, or what?
Are you living on another planet than me? Mine is called "Earth".
