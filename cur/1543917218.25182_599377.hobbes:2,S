PowerPC exports this data via the OpenFirmware so it already shows in 
the /sysfs entries. I was thinking to combine those sysfs entries under this 
code, but that is something in the future.
In regards to all other platforms, I figured I would only make it supported 
under platforms that have been tested. Is there anything that stops this from 
working for example of IA64? Well no. The hardware that supports the iBFT is 
either in the BIOS or in NICs - so the SGI or HP boxes _should_ work, however 
I am not comfortable to make it supported unless I've tested it.

Q: "Why is this function in the header file"
If the find_ibft() was to be implemented in firmware/iscsi_ibft.c code the 
firmware-driver couldn't be compiled as a module (or rather it could, but 
when the vmlinuz was to be linked it would complain about missing symbol - 
find_ibft). I was thinking to let the user give the choice whether they want 
to load this firmware driver or have it built-in the kernel.
Q:"Why is it inline"
Uhh. It does not need to. I will remove the 'inline' part.

Fixed.
Randy,
Thank you for taking time to do such thoroughly review.
