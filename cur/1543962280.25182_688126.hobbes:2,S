OK.
Well I don't know what the heck to do about that.  It could be that we've
gone and changed the contents of (say) an acpi /proc file, and this happens
to cause your particular version of gnome-power-manager to take a different
(and buggy) codepath, so it crashes.  Or something like this.
I hate to do this to you, but our best hope for getting to the bottom of
this is for you to run a git bisection search to find out what we did which
triggered this.  
http://www.kernel.org/doc/local/git-quick.html
 has some
instructions.
Or you could go the other route and work out where and why
gnome-power-manager is crashing.
You could try upgrading (or downgrading) your gnome-power-manager version,
see if that affects things.
Does the problem affect only gnome-power-manager?
