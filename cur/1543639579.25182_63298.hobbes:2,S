I prefer that option, expect that it changes the name of a module.  Not
that we haven't done that before ...
A module name of af_unix would be much better, like af_packet.  It
would require changing the name of af_unix.c (source and conglomerate
objects cannot have the same basename) and a change to modutils to map
net-pf-1 to af_unix.
