yup.  If fixup code is needed.

At present, I'm calling balance_dirty_pages() once per 32 pages within
generic_file_write().  And also once on the way out of generic_file_write().
Even if a zillion threads were writing at the same time, someone will do
an allocation and the VM will then send a pdflush thread off to perform
some writeback.   I think this is all OK.
One possible wart with delayed allocate is that we need to go off
and instantiate disk mappings at writepage() time, which may cause
extra memory squeezes.  I'm not particularly fussed about that at
this time.  It's a VM problem...
balance_dirty_pages does:
	if (dirty_pages > sync_threshold)
		sync_writeback();
	else if (dirty_pages > async_threshold)
		async_writeback();
	else if (dirty_pages > background_threshold)
		tell_a_pdflush_thread_to_do_some_writeback();
Current code is at 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.5/,
but I haven't released it yet :)
That code is presently shoving half-megabyte BIOs direct from
pagecache into the block layer.  There are no buffer_heads used
at all in the write(2) path.  One such BIO saves 128 buffer_head
allocations, 128 bio_allocs and a ton of request merging.
Unfortunately I seem to have found a bug in existing ext2, a bug
in existing block_write_full_page, a probable bug in the aic7xxx
driver, and an oops in the aic7xxx driver.  So progress has slowed
down a bit :(

I reserve the space in the filesystem at ->prepare_write() time.  If
there's no space, I force a writeback to cause all the outstanding
worst-case reservations to be collapsed into real disk mappings.  If
there's still no space, prepare_write returns -ENOSPC.
I terms of memory use, I think balance_dirty_pages takes care of
everything.  If there are too many dirty pages, the caller of
write(2) performs synchronous writeout, just as happens with the
legacy buffer_head-based writeout.
Early days yet.
