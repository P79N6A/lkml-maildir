Subject: [PATCH] EDAC: make default 'Y' to match Kconfig recommendation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/17/87

The help text for EDAC has a clear "If unsure, select 'Y'" note, yet the
default is 'N' - that doesn't add up.
This patch makes DEAC default to 'Y' to match the recommendation.
