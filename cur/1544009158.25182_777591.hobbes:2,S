Can you add something like:
  +++ b/kernel/kmod.c
  @@ -108,6 +108,7 @@ int request_module(const char *fmt, ...)
                  return -ENOMEM;
          }
  +       printk("XXX call modprobe %s %s[%u]\n", module_name,
current->comm, task_pid_nr(current));
It may show which process is looking for /dev/console and causes
modprobe to run, and maybe we get an idea what's going on. It may at
least show if it's a /dev/console problem.
Thanks,
Kay
