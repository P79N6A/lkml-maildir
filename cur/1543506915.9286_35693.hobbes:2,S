PRCS is a different open source revision control system, not
built on top of the RCS suite.  I don't see a problem with a
maintainer choosing PRCS over CVS; it's easy enough for a
successor to start a CVS tree off of a PRCS snapshot just as
Keith snapped the top of the CVS tree off to start a PRCS tree.
