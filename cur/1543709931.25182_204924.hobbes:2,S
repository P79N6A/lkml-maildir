i think they make a forward progress so it's more of a DoS - but a very
effective one, especially considering that i didnt even try hard ...
what worries me is that there are apps that generate such vma patterns
(for various reasons).
I do believe that scanning ->i_mmap & ->i_mmap_shared is fundamentally
flawed.
