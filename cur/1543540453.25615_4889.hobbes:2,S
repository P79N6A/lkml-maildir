Hello, I get (d)msg like one below on 2.0.36pre something
	ip_masq_new(proto=TCP): no free ports.
And indeed like 4098 masq ports are in use. Since expire time (via 
ipfwadm -M -s 86400 0 0) is set for 24hrs, it means I would need to 
wait 24hrs for the ports to free up.
Is there any way to 'flush' those ports now w/out having to wait 24hrs? 
(beside rebooting, that is. It has been up for 625 days so far, so I don't
feel like rebooting it).
