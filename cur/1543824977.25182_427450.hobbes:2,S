Ingo & (I think) Steven,
   -rt25 applies cleanly and boots fine on my AMD64 UMP machine.

   Thanks to all for putting this fix together. I'm sorry I didn't do
much with the 2.6.16-rt series. I was so happy with 2.6.15-rt18 I
never moved forward. I promise to take a lot at 2.6.17 when that comes
along.
Cheers,
Mark
