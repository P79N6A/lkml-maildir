J�rg, this is insulting. Who knows better than Jens if his computer has
needed burn-proof and if his writes have been successful?  You for one
don't. I don't either but at least I don't claim to.
There may be problems with insufficient privileges, problems when pages
aren't locked into memory, problems when cdrecord doesn't have realtime
priority, but that doesn't mean everyone encounters them.
The maintainer's (your) definition of "works" or "no problem" and the
end user's definition of "works" or "no problem" differ by an order of
magnitude. Such is a developer's life.
So consider refining the warnings and tell users what CAN happen if they
continue without root privileges and add a 15 s timer so they can read,
abort and retry with sudo.
