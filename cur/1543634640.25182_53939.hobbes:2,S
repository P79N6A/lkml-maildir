I've got an ASUS A7A266-E motherboard and a 160GB Maxtor hard drive.
The only kernel I've managed to work with this combination is 2.4.18
with Hedrick's IDE patches.
I've tried quite a few of the 2.4.19-pre patches, with or without
various -ac patches, including pre10 + ac2, and they all basically
display one of two behaviors: The machine either hangs just before
detecting the disk, or when doing the partition check for the disk.
Below is the relevant section from dmesg from 2.4.18.
Anybody got any ideas?  What can I do to help debug this?
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
ALI15X3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 20
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:04.0. Please try using pci=biosirq.
