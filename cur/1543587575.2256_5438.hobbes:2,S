Hi,
As described earlier, code which wants to write an inode cannot rely on
the I_DIRTY bits (on inode->i_state) being clean to guarantee that the
inode and its dirty pages, if any, are safely synced on disk.
The reason for that is sync_one() --- it cleans the I_DIRTY bits of an
inode, sets the I_LOCK and starts a writeout. 
If sync_one() is called to write an inode _asynchronously_, there is no
guarantee that an inode will have its data fully synced on disk even if
the inode gets unlocked, which means the previous fix to
generic_osync_inode() is not safe.
The easy and safe fix is to simply remove the I_DIRTY_* checks from
generic_osync_inode and ext2_fsync_inode. Easy but slow. Another fix would
be to make sync_one() unconditionally synchronous... slow.
Any suggestion for a fast, safe, but simple fix to this bug?
