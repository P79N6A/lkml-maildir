Hello Avi,
here is the latest respin of my fixes for the kvm module unload problem:
[PATCH 1/2] anon_inodes: use fops->owner for module refcount
[PATCH 2/2] kvm: set owner of cpu and vm file operations
Both patches fix module reference counting problems and only matter for module
unload - nothing critical. 
Tested on s390 and x86_32.
Christian
