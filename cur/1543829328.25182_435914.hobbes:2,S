I don't recall them promising that but I (personally) looked at CKRM and 
decided that its equivalent functionality was unsuitable as it only 
allowed one client (unlike PAGG and task watchers).  CKRM at that stage 
was one big amorphous lump and trying to use sub components wasn't easy 
as they had been designed to meet CKRM's needs only rather than 
providing some generally useful functionality.
I'm pleased to say that (unless I'm mistaken) that last bit is no longer 
true and CKRM is moving towards providing low level functionality that 
may be generally useful rather than just meeting CKRM's needs.
