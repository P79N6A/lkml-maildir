Maybe the other filesystems are just catching up :)
My experience is reiserfs is amazingly fast at rm -rf.
Here is bonnie++ small file benchmark on reiserfs with more kernels.
A couple of notes.  You see the number of files was reduced recently.  
Also the reiserfs notail option was removed based on a suggestion from
Hans to benefit bigger file benchmarks.

2.5.70             65536   7584  86.7   8751  2628  37.3  7038
2.5.69 was about 20% faster than 2.5.70 on sequential file deletes
on reiserfs.
I haven't benchmarked any 2.4 kernels with 65536 files and
tails yet.
