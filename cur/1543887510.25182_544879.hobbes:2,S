I was using this patch for some days now and I realized that - from time
to time - the touchpad runs amok, i.e. I more or less unable to control
the mouse when that happens.
Then a rmmod appletouch (+ reload) fixes this, as well as a sleep/resume
cycle.
As I had to rmmod appletouch a lot and did not see crashes I think it
works... though this problem persists...
