We already have one. The Linux folks saw the problem much earlier than
windows people because our athlon optimised memory copies triggered it
reliably on many boards.
Whats sad is its taken VIA this long to finally acknowledge a bug that we
have shown existed months and months ago, and even had Linux fixes for a 
while in 2.4
