In general, yes.  The lock may be held for much longer than milliseconds
if the potentially blocking function is waiting for I/O from a network,
or a terminal, potentially causing all threads to block on the lock
until someone presses a key, in this extreme example.  If the lock is a
spinlock, then complete deadlock can occur.
You're probably aware that semaphores are used both as blocking mutex
locks, where the down (lock) and up (unlock) calls are made by the same
thread to protect critical data, and as a synchronization mechanism,
where the down and up calls are made by different threads.   The former
use is a "lock", while the latter down() use is a "potentially blocking
function" in terms of your question.  I don't know how easy it would be
for your analysis tools to distinguish between them.
