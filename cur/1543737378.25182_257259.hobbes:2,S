Object name relationships are established through the rcfs pathname.

Exactly, the controller will enforce that in the same way we
enforce other attributes and shares.
Example, we make sure that the sum of the share "guarantees" for
all children does not exceed the total_guarantee (i.e. denominator)
of the parent.
Nothing prohibits the controller to enforce the set constraints
you describe above and reject requests that are not valid.
As I said before, ideally the controller would be the cpumem set
guts and RCFS would be the API to it.
That's what Andrew was asking for in case the requirement for
this functionality can/is made.

See above.
