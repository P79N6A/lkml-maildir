I tried to reproduce your problem but i didn't succeed yet. I also think
that the IR support could be the problem. Card 3 defines a GPIO based
remote support.  As Mauro mentioned above, this is - at least - dangerous
if you force this card type but you don't have a remote control or just a
different one. This type of remote can use a GPIO port of the SAA713x to
generate interrupts. If this pin is floating on your card, the driver can
just be flooded with IRQs. We should have a look whether we can prevent this
in the IRQ handler.
