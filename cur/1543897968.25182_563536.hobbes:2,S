I've checked the specification of RapidIO. The supporting of RapidIO
extended address modes are 66, 50 and 34 bit.
The Freescale's silicons is only support 34 bit address now.
Do you mean I should not use words -- 'should be <2>'?
The #address-cells should be assigned according the address mode
supported by silicon.
Thanks!
Wei.
