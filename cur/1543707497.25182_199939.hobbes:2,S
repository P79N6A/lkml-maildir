What kernel symbols are you trying to use?
What are you tring to EXPORT?
It mostly looks like something in your main .text section is calling
(or using) something that's in another code section or vice versa.
You might see if one of the scripts from
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/scripts/
will help you.  I can't reach that web site right now, but there
are a couple of scripts there (reference-discarded.pl and
reference-init.pl) that might help you.
or you can always post source code so that we won't have to guess
whatever it is you are doing.
