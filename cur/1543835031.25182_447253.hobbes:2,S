again, it was not consistent, i made it so. It's perfectly fine to line 
up names, especially in structure declarations.

the volatile is quite likely bogus anyway. It made no difference to the 
assembly output.

that's how i mark functions that i cleaned up, i order the variable 
lines by length. (take a look at kernel/sched.c, kernel/rtmutex.c, 
kernel/lockdep.c, etc., etc.) It also looks a tiny bit more structured 
than the usual random dump of variable definitions.

lets not go for longer than 80 chars.

again, consistency. Most places in this file used the one to what i 
corrected it above.

again, lets not have overlong line 80 prototypes.

take a look at the resulting file.

stupid 2 spaces for every line was not OK but we/you can reintroduce 
them after this patch goes in.
(anyway, i'd suggest to also spend some of your review energy on all the 
other 1000 zillion files that have very real and obvious style problems, 
instead of redundantly finetuning the ones i did? The last thing we need 
is the needless blocking of obviously right cleanup patches on small 
silly details, which patches already vastly improve what was there 
before. We can quibble about BSD or non-BSD prototypes after all that 
has been finished.)
