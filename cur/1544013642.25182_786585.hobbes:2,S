This commit added the following text to drivers/gpu/drm/Kconfig :
config DRM_I915_KMS
       bool "Enable modesetting on intel by default"
       depends on DRM_I915
       help
       Choose this option if you want kernel modesetting enabled by default,
       and you have a new enough userspace to support this. Running old
       userspaces with this enabled will cause pain.  Note that this causes
       the driver to bind to PCI devices, which precludes loading things
       like intelfb.
I don't think any 'normal' user has a clue what you guys meant by 
'new and old userspace' . Could someone clarify 'what versions of probably Xorg and libs are
needed to have that support and which are for sure broken or old' please ?
Also while testing this with xorg-server 1.4* I found out the 'pain' means an broken X and a broken box since 
it broke the kernel as well and the only way to get the box to live again was an hard reset. Please clarify the 'pain' part too.
Thanks for your time.
Best regards ,
