Removing any such option was not the objective of this thread, just lifting 
4K stacks from debug and making it the default. People fortunate enough to 
use workloads where some piece of crap code by accident works more often 
with the current shared 8K stacks then it does with the unshared 4K stacks 
can then still nicely not select it (or fix the code if possible).
