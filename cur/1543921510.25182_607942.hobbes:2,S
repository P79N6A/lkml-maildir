Hi Andrew,
some time ago we were talking about doing write-back from inside a file-system 
(
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119097117713616&w=2
). You said that I'm not 
the only person who needs this, because the same thing is needed for delayed 
allocation.
The problem is that if we initiate write-back from prepare_write() and we are 
having a dirty page lock, we deadlock in write_cache_pages() which tries to 
lock the same page.
You suggested to enhance struct writeback_control and put page that should be 
skipped.
I tried something like
diff --git a/include/linux/writeback.h b/include/linux/writeback.h

                          * lock on the page itself: the page may be truncated
but it does not dot actually work, because if we have two processes forcing 
write-back from write_page(), they will mutually deadlock (A waits in 
write_cache_pages() on a page B has locked, B waits on inode or page A has locked).
So this way is not ok, do you have any other ideas?
We could mark page clean temporarily before doing write-back, and mark it dirty 
again, but this seems to be inefficient (although I'm not sure, need to dig 
these functions deeper, but they _seem_ to traverse the radix tree and change 
tags, so marking one page dirty may need to change many tags, but again, I did 
not really dig tis yet).
I'd appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!
