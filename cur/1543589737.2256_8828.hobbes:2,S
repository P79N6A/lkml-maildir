Either upgrade to a distro that includes the new kernel
(e.g. latest SuSE or Red Hat) or download kernel source
and compile. It might be helpful to provide the distribution
and version you are using (Red Hat 6.2, Slackware 7,
Debian Potato, etc)

Yes, of course iptables won't work with the old kernel.
If you want to stay with the old kernel, you must use
ipchains instead.
