Hi (ingo/linus/alan/somebody),
	I was wondering if you could offer a few comments on the implications
of the new highmem code.
	It seems like the highmem additions are causing conceptual changes
(some definately good) in the ARCHITECTURE INDEPENDANT code.  While it
makes some sense to alter the architecture independant code in linux/mm,
it also kind of seems like the highmem stuff should be in arch/i386.
	If you have a few minutes, could you say why the current changes make
sense, or where they are going?
many thanks,
-BenRI
