Yes, you are right, to find out the root cause is better. Thank you
for all your suggestion and information to us.
Since we have little experience on PCI and MSI here, we had to try to
disable MSI  before we find a better solution. But as you are giving
us help now on this case, it's great! Then let's go...

I'm using kernel 2.6.23-rc5 to debug this MSI problem, which can NOT
boot on our Trevally board(RS690+SB700) without any kernel modification.
But if I comment out all the pci_intx() function calls in
drivers/pci/msi.c, it can boot now with MSI enabled as you expected!
# cat /proc/interrupts

LOC:     174285     174210

Also if I keep the pci_intx() calls in drivers/pci/msi.c and ONLY
comment out the pci_intx() call in drivers/ata/ahci.c
My system can boot up too with MSI enabled!
So does it mean that the root cause is our SB700 SATA controller
has a hardware bug where setting INTX_DISABLE in the PCI COMMAND
register masks MSI interrupts too? 
And what is the software solution or workaround?
I will continue debug this MSI problem next week. Any suggestions,
please don't hesitate to tell us.
Thanks
Best Regards
Shane
