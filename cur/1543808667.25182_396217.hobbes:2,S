Right. Thats one way to put it.

Ugh, sorry, I dont really remember why I put it there.
I guess I just have easier time reasoning about locks than barriers and atomic
operations. "bit is protected by priv->lock" is a simple rule, and we are not on
data path here. The fact that the race went unnoticed for a while validates
this approach in my eyes.
I guess longer term we will replace mcast_mutex with priv->lock anyway, so it
doesnt matter much.
