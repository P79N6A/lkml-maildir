I'd rather memcpy_to/from_io only made guarantees about the start/end of
the transfer and not order of read/writes or size of read/writes. The
reason being that a more restrictive sequence can be efficiently
expressed using read/writefoo but the reverse is not true.

Why not. Providing it is in MMIO space, consider ROMs for example or
write path consider frame buffers.
