   That is probably because *usually* all of the data is accepted by
   one write[v]. But the specification is quite specific in stating
   that a short write is not an error.
True.

   That is bad programming then. If you look in a text such as "UNIX
   Network Programming" by Richard Stevens, or the manual page for write
   under Solaris, or even (gasp) the documentation for send() on Windows NT,
   they all speak of partial writes on a socket.
   The "standard" way to handle a write on a socket correctly is:
Correct, in fact have a look at
	xc/programs/Xserver/os/io.c:FlushClient()
from the X sources.
It has this exact structure and manages partial writev() calls just
fine.
Really, it's pretty clear that a partial writev is valid and properly
written applications have no problems at all with it.
