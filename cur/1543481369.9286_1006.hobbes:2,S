Hi,
I have a Hauppauge TV card with a bt878 chip. Before linux-2.2.0-pre8 the
bt848 driver included in the kernel didn't work for my card. It showed a
scrambled tv image. However the bttv driver included in the xawtv packages
worked fine since version 2.26. 
The kernel patch patch-2.2.0pre7ac4 was the first time my wintv card
worked as it should. The next two patches patch-2.2.0-pre8 and
patch-2.2.0-pre9 do show a clear TV image but the system freezes. The only
responce I get is with ping from another system. After a reboot I don't
see any logged error messages. The last messages is: msp3400: init: 
chip=MSP3410D-B4, has NICAM support (my card has a MSP3415D chip). 
It didn't help to install the bttv driver from the new xawtv package
(version 2.34). I get the same result. 
I have these lines in my /etc/conf.modules
alias char-major-81 bttv pre-install bttv modprobe "-k" msp3400; modprobe
"-k" tuner options tuner debug=0 type=5 options bttv card=10 radio=1 pll=1
vidmem=0xe60
My system is a AMD K6-2 300, a riva128 video card with pgcc-2.91.60 (egcs
1.1.1). 
I hope this problem can be fixed (as in patch-2.2.0pre7ac4) before kernel
2.2 is released. 
Regards,
Koos Vriezen
