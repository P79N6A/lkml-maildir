It could be any driver code that uses uninterruptible sleeps rather
than interruptible sleeps I believe. If a process is doing a read or
write to one of these devices and it stays stuck in kernel code with
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and never gets it's expected wake up, then the
signal will never be delivered and the process is stuck indefinately.
The buggy driver code needs to be fixed (either to use interruptible
sleeps and handle the signals or to imlement some sort of timeout).
