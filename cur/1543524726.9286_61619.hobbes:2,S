	Note for the unwashed...  You technically can not remove DES without
removing 3DES.  3DES is three passes through the DES algorithm with either
two keys (112 bit EDE mode) or three keys.  You still have the DES algo
at it's heart.  We may removed external ACCESS to the DES algo, but it
still has to be there.

	Unless we have PK signed modules.  Then it gets real iffy.

	Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  It would provide transparent access to
crypto cards and hardware accelerators.

	I will follow up on it.  Thanks for that reference!
