I'm using the ide patch "ide.2.2.19.05042001" for 2.2.19.   In 2.4.5 this cdr 
wsa detected as a cdr.  here it's detected as:
  Vendor: CREATIVE  Model:  CD-RW RW8438E    Rev: FC03
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Cdrecord says this.
cdrecord: Invalid argument. Cannot get mmap for 4198400 Bytes on /dev/zero.
TOC Type: 1 = CD-ROM
How do i make it be detected as a cdrw or at least cdr?
