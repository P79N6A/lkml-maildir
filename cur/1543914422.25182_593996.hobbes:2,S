Nope.  The safety is against the particular item you're iterating on
being removed; it doesn't protect against the *next* entry being removed
when you drop the lock.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by the latter comment...

Yes, that's what it's there for. :-)

You don't need to bind to it for that, though -- just call of_get_parent
from the channel probe.  Though it might be easier to bind to the parent
to ensure that you only register the IRQ once.
