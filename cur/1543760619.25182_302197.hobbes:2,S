With all due respect to the people that it will take to make that 
happen, thats a heck of a good idea.  However, what I'd like to see 
is a difference between whats output to the screen during bootup (set 
that to relatively quiet unless a problem is hit) but to continue to 
log the full output to /var/log/dmesg-$date when the ring is dumped 
and syslog can then take the rest of it.
Overwriting /var/log/dmesg at every boot removes a lot of forensic 
info that could come in handier than sliced bread and bottled beer at 
times.  Let rotatelog take care of deleting anything more than a week 
out of date so they don't take up space once their usefullness has 
expired.
How many 'aye's do I hear?
