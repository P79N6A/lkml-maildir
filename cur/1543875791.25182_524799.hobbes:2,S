OOPS (hand-pasted), happens on roughly 85% of bootups, didn't seem to
occur during my several previous 2.6.21-rc4-mm1 bootups:

Any hints? Possibly existing bug surfaced due to RSDL scheduling timing
differences? I did NOT test -mm1 to check this.
P3/700 UP i815 IDE ext3, Debian unstable.
Further .config available on request.
Note that something killed my /bin/run-parts (Debian) and S10portmap files
(and possibly some others are corrupted??), so it might be something fishy
(but this fishiness could also have uncovered this OOPS, so...).
Restoring those files didn't change the status quo.
CC'd relevant maintainers/recent submitters.
