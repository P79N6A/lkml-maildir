	Can you find me where any standard says that local UNIX datagrams can't
have lengths of less than one byte? It's really this simple -- you don't
have the guarantee you think you have. Yes, the kernel could be nicer. But
what you're trying to do (foist on the kernel the job of transmit scheduling
on a connectionless socket) is fundamentally wrong.
