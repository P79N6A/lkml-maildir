(Note, I work in the GCC group, not the Linux group, so the following is MHO,
and not Red Hat gospel).
Assuming you've installed the compiler/other relevant tools, installed the
kernel source, and have enough disk space to build the kernel.  This would
screw people wanting to install Linux on their old 386/486/pentium for use as a
firewall or web server.  For example, the machine I'm planning on moving a web
server to only has 2 gig of disk.  Right now, I have barely enough space to
hold the compiler tools plus web pages I want to serve.  If I was serving much
more content, I would probably chuck the compiler tools/kernel source.
