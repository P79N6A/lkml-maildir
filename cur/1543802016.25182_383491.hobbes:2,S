akpm changed the condition statement below with an if test.  So it is needed now.

Don't we still need rmb for the RUSAGE_SELF case? we do not take the
siglock for rusage self and the non c* signal fields are written to 
at __exit_signal...
What is wrong with optimizing by not taking the siglock in RUSAGE_BOTH
and RUSAGE_CHILDREN?  I would like to add that in too unless  I am
missing something and the optimization is incorrect.
Thanks,
