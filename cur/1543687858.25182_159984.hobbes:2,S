Not that I know of. This would probably require an extra layer of
indirection in the standard form of Linux's struct of pointers to
functions, with your standard schedule functions as wrappers.
I think it would be highly unlikely that this would get into a
standard kernel, but might make a nice testing tool...
In fact this might end up being incompatible with architectures
like SPARC... but I'm sure someone could make it work if they really
wanted to.
I think the present boot-time selector (selecting different kernels
at boot) will have to suffice for now :P
