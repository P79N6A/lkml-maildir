This is the first time I'll have sent anything to this list, and I hadn't
planned on sending anything for a long time to come, but I think in this
case I must toss in my 2cents.
While I understand the reasoning behind this, and might do the same thing if
I was in your position, I feel it may be a mistake.
I personaly do not trust the 2.4.x kernel entirely yet, and would prefer to
wait for 2.4.1 or 2.4.2 before upgrading from 2.2.18 to ensure last-minute
wrinkles have been completely ironed out, and I know there are people who
share my viewpoint, and would rather use 2.2.XX for a while yet, and I'm
afraid that this may partialy criple 2.2 driver development.
It can take little or a lot of time to port a driver from 2.2 to 2.4, and in
some cases people may just not want to do it untill 2.4 has gone through a
little more refining, and that could take a while.
To sum it up, I just don't think this is the right decision to make, at
least not yet.
My opinion probably won't matter one bit, but I thought I might as well toss
it out there.
