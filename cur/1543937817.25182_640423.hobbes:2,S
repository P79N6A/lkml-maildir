Freeing a const pointer is not and has never been unusual.  It happens
all the time for objects whose lifecycle is "initialise at the start,
readonly afterwards", of which names, in particular in the form of
strings, are a large subset.  It also happens in cases of late
deletion on refcounted objects, when the main owner (the one who is
allowed to change the object and has the non-const pointer) has
dropped its reference, but some object needs a readonly instance a
little longer.  Think virtual files in proc, sysfs or friends kept
open after the underlying information source, often a device, is gone.
