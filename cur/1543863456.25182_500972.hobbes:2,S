That's the problem all about. I don't have problems finding info about
a kernel feature or about a driver patch. But even for me it takes
some time to figure it out. (I don't work only with Linux......do work
with Mac OS, and Solaris too. But less of Windows!)
Am talking from the Linux users point of view (who need to know deep
about the Kernel development, etc. Imagine, a student or a
professional who wants to build a kernel with a patch for a i686
machine? Can't we simplify this at www.kernel.org home page instead of
user being lost in searching on Google or wherever?

I would like to contribute here, in any way. Fine graining might be a
problem. But we can give info in general? Example, if patch-2.6.19.3
comes out - simply we can say as *x86 32/64* based on the weightage of
fixes in that patch. What do you say?

I never depend on a distributor's kernel, especially Fedora has a
Generic one with many things enabled into the kernel. The moment I
install a distro....my hands would be itchy to build my own kernel
which is very specific to my H/W. No less or more. In this way I can
live with my best made kernel ;-)
[OT] Some posts I send does not appear on LKML. Even this one, I
couldn't find on list :( What might be the problem?
