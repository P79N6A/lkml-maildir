It may appear not necessary that providing more multithreaded device
probing in the driver core, but it seems more necessary that providing
more parallel control in the driver core to make some device probing
more single-threaded.
There does exist multithreaded device probing in current driver core
implementation, supposing two devices are hot-plugged at the same time.
But, many device drivers are written without this taken into account. I
think it may be better to make default device probing process more
single-threaded in the driver core. The single-thread workqueue or some
customized version of workqueue like that implemented by my patch can be
used for this. The parallel control mechanism can be used to implement
multithreaded device probing in needed subsystems too.

Huang, Ying
