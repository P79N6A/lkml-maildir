Subject: [patch] flushpage and buffercache size

The current (2.3.12) flushpage done over a whole page (to release all the
bh headers) is doing:
 	if (!offset) {
 		if (!try_to_free_buffers(page))
			atomic_add(PAGE_CACHE_SIZE, &buffermem);
 	}
But IMO the try_to_free_buffers() should never fail (well except in
the ramdisk case that seems to be not addressed yet). The buffer is
trashed, it's been completly invalidated and there's no reason for left it
in memory. Nobody can start I/O in the meantime since we hold the
page-lock and we carefully waited for all previous in progress I/O to
complete before try to free the buffers. So it seems to me that if
try_to_free_buffers fails we have some problem somewhere (maybe I
overlooked something...).
