Just another kbuild 2.4 bug.  During make clean/mrproper directory
traversal Rules.make is included.  Rules.make unconditionally includes
.depend from this directory and the global .hdepend, no matter what the
target is.
It can be fixed but there are more important problems and nobody has
got round to it.  rm the broken .[h]depend file gets around the bug.
