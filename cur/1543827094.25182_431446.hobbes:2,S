One of the costs (and I'm not disagreeing with your main point;
I think forking ext3 to ext4 at this point is reasonable), is that
bugfixes applied to one don't necessarily get applied to the other.
I found some recently between ext2 and ext3, and submitted those, but I
only audited one file.  There's lots more to look at and I just haven't
found the time recently.  Going to three variations is a lot more work
for auditing, and it might be worth splitting some bits which genuinely
are the same into common code.
