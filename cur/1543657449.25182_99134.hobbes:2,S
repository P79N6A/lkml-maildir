Do you really need the "video=vesa:off" boot parameter? If no VESA graphics
mode was activated by the boot loader, vesafb will not start. If your kernel
contains both vesafb and vgacon, it will fall back to VGA text mode.

This is not the kernel prompt, but the prompt of your bootloader. So you should
modify your bootloader to not ask you for a mode if the wanted VESA graphics
mode is not available, but to continue with VGA text.
