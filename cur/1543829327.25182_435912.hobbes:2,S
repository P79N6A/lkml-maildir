Would it not make sense to call this driver ip3204 or ph_ip3204 or some such seeing as you
correctly point out that this is a common Philips IP block and is used in other, non pnx, chips?
I'm also not sure why the register map is in the arch-pnx4008 directory as this will require every
chip that has this IP block to have a copy of the file.
