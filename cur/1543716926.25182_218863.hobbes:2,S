you mean the 1009 bios? It doesn't fix anything.
I'm using it and:
dmesg output:
...
Asus A7N8X-X detected: BIOS IRQ0 pin2 override will be ignored
...
PCI: nForce2 C1 Halt Disconnect fixup
...
(I'm the one that told Len about the new bios that doesn't fix the pin2
bug and afair, the C1 Halt Disconnect fix checked for flawed values, ie,
this bios dosn't fix anything...)
