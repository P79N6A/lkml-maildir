Dear diary, on Mon, Aug 19, 2002 at 06:37:19AM CEST, I got a letter,
where "David S. Miller" <davem@redhat.com> told me, that...

FYI, early at this morning (UTC), Yuji Sekiya <sekiya@sfc.wide.ad.jp> wrote on
the USAGI list:

Yes, we will send patches to mainline kernel.
At least we will send the below patches by end of Setpember.
We are now working.
- IPv6 default route fix
- Source address seletcion
- Privacy extension
- IPv4/IPv6 double bind
- NDP timer improvement
- IPsec for IPv6
======
So, let's watch them and hope that they will fulfill this and send some usable
patches to you..
PS: Sorry for replying to such an old thread, I only thought that people not
subscribed on the USAGI mailing list may be still interested in this.
