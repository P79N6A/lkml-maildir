Surely this is the root cause ... you can't expect that the alignment
rules of HOSTCC to make any sense for an arbitraty target.

What's so special about this structure that we get an error?  Surely
there are many kernel structures with different alignment/padding
when built with i386 complier compared with ia64 compiler.  We can't
go around manually padding them all (it wastes time, and also wastes
memory on the 32-bit systems that don't need this padding).
