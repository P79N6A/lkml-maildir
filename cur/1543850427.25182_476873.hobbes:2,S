Perhaps I'm mistaken, but the code accumulates the value it 
finds in sched_info.pcnt in the task_struct. Now, in sched.h I found this:
struct sched_info {
 	/* cumulative counters */
 	unsigned long	cpu_time,	/* time spent on the cpu */
 			run_delay,	/* time spent waiting on a runqueue */
 			pcnt;		/* # of timeslices run on this cpu */
The comment says that these counters are cumulative... The code that 
updates them (sched.c: sched_info_arrive()), does accumulate them.
In include/linux/taskstats.h, I found:
          * xxx_count is the number of delay values recorded
          * xxx_delay_total is the corresponding cumulative delay in nanoseconds
I interpret these comments as saying that:
cpu_delay should be the total number of nanoseconds a task has been 
waiting in a runqueue for a CPU, and cpu_count is equal to the number of 
times the task got the CPU (or waited for it). If so, then the code 
updates taskstats.cpu_delay_total incorrectly too (which my patch didn't 
fix).
If not, then the comments in taskstats.h are very confusing....
