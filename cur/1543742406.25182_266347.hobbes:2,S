Does it say this about %esp?
The stack pointer is SPECIAL, guys. It's special exactly because there is
potentially extra hardware in CPU's that track its value _independently_
of the actual physical register.
Just for fun, google for 'x86 "stack engine"', and you'll hit for example 
http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/cpu/pentium-m.ars/5
 which talks 
about this and perhaps explains it in ways that I apparently haven't been 
able to.
