How do you handle "rm dir1/main.c dir2/main.c" ??? Both files have the
same name. And how about VFAT (no inode numbers...).
If you create a shadow directory tree, how do you handle the quota problem?
What happens to files deleted by fsck? (which depends on the disk
implementation of the FS and not the VFS)
Is there a design document or FAQ somewhere ?
(I did have to deal with VMS for a while - our solution: Don't do that...
recovery was just too much of a hassle)
