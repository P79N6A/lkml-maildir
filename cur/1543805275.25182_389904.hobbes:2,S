No, because the thread that just released the mutex is obviously not one 
of  the threads blocked on the mutex. When a mutex is unlocked, one of 
the *waiting* threads at the time of the unlock must acquire it, and the 
scheduling policy can determine that. But the thread the released the 
mutex is not one of the waiting threads, and is not eligible for 
consideration.
