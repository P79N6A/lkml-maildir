I still have 1G boxes (and even an 800Meg) HD boxes that I sometimes
develop on.  And these things are not very fast either, so doing the tar
bzip2 is also slow.  So I have deleted not only archs, but drivers that
I don't need to work on these and to keep the code there.
Now, I mainly do the development on a bigger and faster machine, and
only do the make install via nfs. But that wasn't always an option.
