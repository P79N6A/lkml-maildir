I'm fascinated that not a single person picked up on this problem
whilst the agp code sat in -mm. Even if DRI isn't enabled,
every box out there with AGP that uses the generic routines
(which is a majority), should have barfed loudly when it hit
this check during boot.  Does no-one read dmesg output any more ?
Maybe OSDL can add an automated test to send diffs of dmesg
between kernels like they do the automated warning announcements 8-)
