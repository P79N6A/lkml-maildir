No release function for this device?  Brave...

Woah, you are registering a driver that is associated with no bus?  
Where would this driver show up in the driver model?
What are you trying to achieve here?

What are you doing with this device?  It will work this way, but would
be nicer if you hook it up to something.  Can you have more than one
vesafb_device per system?
You also need to consider changing those .name fields to something that
looks sane in the sysfs tree.
