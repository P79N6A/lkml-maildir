Ted, as a start, we can move the (un)lock_kernel() calls from the ext3
code into the journal_start() and journal_stop(), and then continue to
push it down into the places where we need it and/or replace it with a
better lock.  This not only makes the lock migration easier, but also
ensures that we always have the lock when we need it.
Cheers, Andreas
