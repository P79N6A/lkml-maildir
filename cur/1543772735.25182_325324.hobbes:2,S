Yes, due to those problem, I have reduced all devices speed on both
controllers. Now I think I can put the HD to 160 and my CD-writers to
20 :-) (Maybe I could try to also put the DVD-Rom to 20).
Do you think it's safe to use this patched 2.6.12-rc6 (I could stay
under 2.6.12-rc2 till 2.6.12-rc7 or 2.6.12 comes out) ?
Thank you very much,
