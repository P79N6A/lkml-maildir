Actually, this may indeed be what I want!
I think this can be implemented with the checks
that Denis Vlasenko suggests. Something like this
can be added to entry.S, right before the "iret":
---
if (!(old_EFLAGS & VM_MASK) && (descr_old_SS is 16bit one))
  push_a_stack_frame_to_return_to_the_ring1_trampoline();
---
This way the overhead for the normal case would be
something about 4 asm insns (the check), and for the
dosemu case - who cares? (and probably also the wine
people will value that)
Does this look reasonable? If it does, I think I
should just start implementing that.
