How about this for a documentation fix?

The current pci_map_sg API is a bit unclear what it is allowed
to modify in the passed scatterlist when coalescing entries.
Clarify the pci_map_sg API to prevent it from modifying
the page, offset, and length fields in the scatterlist.

 Then you should loop count times (note: this can be less than nents times)
 and use sg_dma_address() and sg_dma_len() macros where you previously
