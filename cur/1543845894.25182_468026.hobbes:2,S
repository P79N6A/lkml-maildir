We do. Frequently, because it tends to break in some manner every
single time we push a rebased kernel update.
wireless-tools v28 is in the updates repo right now, which afaik, is
already the newest available.
It's seriously unfunny to have to update fundamental userspace packages
like this when moving to a newer kernel. Especially when say for eg,
the newer kernel then has a broken sound driver, so the user goes
back to their old 'working' kernel. Oops, now they have a choice
of a kernel with broken sound, or a kernel with broken wireless.
