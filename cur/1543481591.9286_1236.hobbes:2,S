I don't know why you expected smbfs to be faster than NFS... NFS is a
simplistic design, SMB is not (not even close).
We use both here... NFS is pretty good most of the time, even over
slow wan links. SMB is pretty hideous on circuits less than 256K or
so, and some operations (like expanding the network neighborhood tree
under Win98 and damned painful -- even over a lan).
For copying large files (100MB+) about, both seem on a par with each
other...
