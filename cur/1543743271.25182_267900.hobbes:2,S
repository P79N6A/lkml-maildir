Kernel 2.6.9
Let's see ... in 2.6.8(.1) one could not burn audio CDs.
In kernel 2.6.9 it seems that the Intel i810 video driver is useless (junk
on the screen ... lockup) and one can no longer compile alsa-lib-1.0.6 from
the source at alsa-project.org. That's as far as I got before I now have to
recompile the working 2.6.7 (if only gimp worked with it ...).
I guess I have to go back to kernel 2.6.7 and await 2.6.10.
(Fedora Core2: xorg-x11-6.8.1-4 from RPM, gcc-3.3.3-7, most of my .config
               for kernel 2.6.9 a duplicate of what was working in 2.6.7)
