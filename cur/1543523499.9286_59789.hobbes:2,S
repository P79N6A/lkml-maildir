There is another problem here that took a while to boil up out of the back
of my mind.  It is not enough to run the generator against some standard &
declare:  "This has x entropy".  The amount of randomness can be
tremendously influenced by the precise code being run.  Youn'uns ask the
old'uns about setting transitor radios next to computers so you could hear
what the thing was up to.  Now that I think about it, it would almost have
qualified as a debugging tool!  (My experience was with a TRS-80 Model
T<bk>I.)
