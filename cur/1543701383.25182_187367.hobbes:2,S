Since processor ID info is available, there's no
need for per-CPU naming. (I do realize it may be
per-disk or per-filesystem though)
With the huge NUMA boxes, a simple "ps -ef" is
going to look insane. How about task groups for
them? Then the various threads wind up being
seen as just that, threads.
BTW, some (p->pid==0) tests may need to become
(p->tgid==0) tests instead.
