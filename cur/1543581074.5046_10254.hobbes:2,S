so you have two concepts in one here
1. SG items that can be more then a single page
2. a container for #1 that includes details for completion callbacks, etc
it looks like Linus is objecting to having both in the same structure and
then using that structure as your generic low-level bucket.
define these as two seperate structures, the #1 structure may now be
lightweight enough to be used for networking and other functions, and when
you go to use it with disk IO you then wrap it in the #2 structure. this
still lets you have the completion callbacks at as low a level as you
want, you just have to explicitly add this layer when it makes sense.
