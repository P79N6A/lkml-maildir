Not according to my diffstat, it doesn't:

The basic rationale for this one is that it corrects a late spotted
error in a driver update that went into 2.6.12.  Without this, the
qla2xxx driver crashes for numerous people on loading (linux-scsi has
all the bug reports).  Since it's clearly a bug fix correcting a major
feature failure, that qualifies it for -stable.  The two code cleanup
corrections look trivial and not worth delaying this over (also, as has
been pointed out, they make it identical with the patch applied upstream
of 2.6.12, so there wouldn't be any merge issues).
