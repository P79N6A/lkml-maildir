Well, three maintainers listed for this driver, but the only email address
they want to give out there is:
linux-omap-open-source@linux.omap.com
which leads to:
"You are not allowed to post to this mailing list, and your message has
been automatically rejected.  If you think that your messages are
being rejected in error, contact the mailing list owner at
linux-omap-open-source-owner@linux.omap.com."
I think the real "bad patch" that should've been "NAK"ed here was the
original patch to MAINTAINERS itself that introduced this entry.
