the last lines should read
+               (unsigned long) idle,
+               (idle_remainder * 100) / HZ);
since idle already got divided by HZ a couple of lines earlier.
Btw., the common convention used by kernel hackers is that you can do
  > cd linux-2.4.22-ac1
  > patch -p1 < ../whatever.patch
while with your patches one has to use -p2.
