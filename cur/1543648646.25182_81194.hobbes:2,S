I also had problems on an DUAL-AMD board, and also with a single
AMD board (SMP kernel though).  It works without problems in a P-IV
board though.  I compiled my kernels for Athlon target, and the P-IV
for the P-IV processor specifically.  I wonder if using a generic
x386 kernel would fix something...
Let me know what you find out!
