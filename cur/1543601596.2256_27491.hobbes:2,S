Could you run gdb on your mount and show us what *data contains at this
point (last parameter).  According to man(8) "defaults" expands to
"rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,nouser,async".  You could also try putting
all of these in /etc/fstab explicitly and remove them one at a time
until we find which one it is complaining about.  Either mount(8)
shouldn't be appending this option to the mount data, or reiserfs
needs to parse it in the kernel.

Works OK, no option data passed.

Works OK, has "notail" but not any other options from "defaults".
