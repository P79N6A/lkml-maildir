Patience is likely to be effective.  The chipset isn't exactly rare
being on SMP boards from Gigabyte, MSI, Tyan and Asus, and likely
others.  I'm betting it will be fixed soon enough.  UP and 2.2.x
kernels worked fine here if you're really desperate.  OTOH, the
board is stable once you get past the boot problems... What sort
of production system needs frequent unattended boots?
Sorry about this, I just don't remember signing any paychecks for
what I know is likely to be a non-issue probably before the next
time I actually have to do something drastic, like reboot.
