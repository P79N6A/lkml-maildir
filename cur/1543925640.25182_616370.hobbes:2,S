What is better depends on the values of ns and NSEC_PER_SEC.
It can be a performance regression, but there are also cases where it 
can improve performance. If gcc produces lower performance code that
would be a bug in gcc that should be reported, but using a division is 
not generally wrong.
A more clearer example might be:
<--  snip  -->
void foo(u64 ns)
{
	if (ns < 10000)
		return;
	while(ns >= 3) {
		ns -= 3;
#ifdef DEBUG
		bar(ns);
#endif
	}
}
<--  snip  -->
With DEBUG not defined you can hardly argue gcc should be fixed to not 
use a division for performance reasons.
