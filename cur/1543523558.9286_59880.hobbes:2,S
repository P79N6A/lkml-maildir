 Richard:
          I have already tried this, it also hangs before I get any
"Uncompressing" message. I also tried using LOADLIN from a floppy, and
I get the same thing. I can take these same boot disks to another
computer and they boot fine. It never gets far enough to have a problem
with mounting the root. It would seem to me that something is going
wrong in arch/i386/boot/setup.S, but I don't know my way around this
part of the software well enough to figure out what is going wrong.
The kernel compile can't be broken because floppy will boot on other
systems, including the system it was compiled on.

Just copy bzImage to a raw floppy, i.e.,
 `cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /dev/fd0`
The root-device is probably be wrong so it will fail to mount root, but
the floppy should boot, uncompress, etc. This will tell you where to
look for other problems. 
If the symptoms are the same, the kernel is probably broken in the
compile. You need to make sure you have the most recent tools. Look
in ../linux/Documentation/Changes.
If the system boots, but can't mount the root file-system, just
`rdev` either the floppy itself or the bzImage file and do it again.
`rdev /tmp/bzImage /dev/whatever_your_root_is`
`cp /tmp/bzImage /dev/fd0`
It should boot and, if your root-fs driver has been compiled in,
mount the root. The machine is now working normally. It just didn't
boot from the hard-disk. This would show that something about the
lilo configuration file isn't right.
Cheers,
