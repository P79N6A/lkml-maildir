I see your problem now... You can't read!
The standard don't just say "Must be zero" it also says that it is reserved.
Reserved is very explicitly defined elseware... In the language of RFCs (and
most of engineering) it means 'you must always set it as specified' when
generating, and you must never behave differently because of it.
