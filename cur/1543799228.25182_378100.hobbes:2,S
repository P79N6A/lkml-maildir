Hi,
I read about a generic device class driver
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109419719600753&w=2)
for GPIO. I wanted to know if anything generic finally came out of the
dicussion ?
I'm willing to write a gpio driver and I am considering taking Robert
Schwebel patch into it if nothing exist in the main line.
Thanks in advance for any info.
Ivan
