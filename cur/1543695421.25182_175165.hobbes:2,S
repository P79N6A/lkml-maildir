Should this make a difference speedwise with SiI 3112? I have one Maxtor 
120GB, and one Seagate 120GB each attached to the SiI controller (Mobo: 
Asus A7N8X Deluxe). The Seagate (my main drive) is as slow as ever (since 
DMA was turned on by default, ~13MB/s), although hdparm reports better 
numbers for the Maxtor (~33MB/s).
