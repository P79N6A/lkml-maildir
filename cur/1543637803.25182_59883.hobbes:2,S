On a Laptop Gericom 1.st Supersonic 
Processot PIII 1000 MHz
256 MB RAM
30 GB HD
2 USB 1.1 
2 PCMCIA (1) eg. 1 PCMCIA (2)
with Linux SuSE 7.3
Kernel 2.4.10-GB (SuSE)
I have 
1 USB Mouse
and
1 Maxtor 40 GB Personal Storage 3000 LE USB 2.0
1 Partition ext2,
with uhci and usb-storage drivers for the HD.
Everything works fine.
scp works fine when the external HD is not mounted.
But, when trying to use scp over PCMCIA Gericom 10/100 Card with the external HD mounted,(writing to the internal or the external HD, working in an X-console or working console without any X) the console used will hang itself up. 
Neither the console nor scp nor the mounts can be killed by kill -9 *. 
You can lock and lockout on other consoles/terminals.
Shutdown -h now does not give any comments, but does not shut the system down. You have to cut the power off.
Used seperately the interrupts used by the PCMCIA-card and the external HD differ. That is not the cause.
Is there an explanation? Can anything be done about it.
