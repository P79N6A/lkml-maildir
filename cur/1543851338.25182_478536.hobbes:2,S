Seriously. I'm seeing that patches also. New, shiny, always ready "for
inclusion". But considering kernel (linux in this case) as not thing
for itself, i want to ask following question.
Where's real-life application to do configure && make && make install?
There were some comments about laking much of such programs, answers were
"was in prev. e-mail", "need to update them", something like that.
"Trivial web server" sources url, mentioned in benchmark isn't pointed
in patch advertisement. If it was, should i actually try that new
*trivial* wheel?
Saying that, i want to give you some short examples, i know.
*Linux kernel <-> userspace*:
o Alexey Kuznetsov  networking     <-> (excellent) iproute set of utilities;
o Maxim Krasnyansky tun net driver <-> vtun daemon application;
*Glibc with mister Drepper* has huge set of tests, please search for
`tst*' files in the sources.
To make a little hint to you, Evgeniy, why don't you find a little
animal in the open source zoo to implement little interface to
proposed kernel subsystem and then show it to The Big Jury (not me),
we have here? And i can not see, how you've managed to implement
something like that having almost nothing on the test basket.
Very *suspicious* ch.
One, that comes in mind is lighthttpd <
http://www.lighttpd.net/>.
It had sub-interface for event systems like select,poll,epoll, when i
checked its sources last time. And it is mature, btw.
Cheers.
