David, I do not follow your logic here, sorry.
I wrote that a path exists from a function that is legal in
interrupt context (pci_pool_free) into a function that is
not legal in interrupt context (pci_free_consistent).
The change breaks that connection. Note that pci_pool_free
is called when driver operates normally.
When you write "fix documentation and broken drivers", you talk
about a fix for a part that processes PCI remove. This is entirely
fine by me. But I was talking about a regular interrupt procession
in driver. A fix in pci remove does not fix regular processing.
