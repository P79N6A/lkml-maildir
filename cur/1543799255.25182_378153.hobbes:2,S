This does not look like it was added to fix a race or historical
to me. I think without that "wake_up" a waiter can miss wakeup
if it is not the only one sleeper.
sem->count == 0, ->sleepers == 0. down() decrements ->count,
__down:
	// ->count == -1
	++sleepers; // == 1
	for (;;) {
		->count += (->sleepers - 1); // does nothing
		if (->count >= 0) // NO
			break;
		->sleepers = 1;
		schedule();
	...
Another process calls down(), ->count == -2
__down:
	++sleepers; // == 2;
	for (;;) {
		->count += (->sleepers - 1) // ->count == -1;
		->sleepers = 1;
		schedule();
	...
up() makes ++->count == 0, and wakes one of them. It will see
->sleepers == 1, so atomic_add_negative(sleepers - 1) again
has no effect, sets ->sleepers == 0 and takes the semaphore.
Note that subsequent up() will not call wakeup(): ->count == 0,
it just increment it. That is why we are waking the next waiter
in advance. When it gets cpu, it will decrement ->count by 1,
because ->sleepers == 0. If up() (++->count) was already called,
it takes semaphore. If not - goes to sleep again.
Or my understanding is completely broken?
Oleg.
