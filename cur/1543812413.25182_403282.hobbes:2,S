In case you are coming late to the thread:
The lost ticks are closely correlated with sata_nv disk activity on
multiple disks, and the problem is easily reproducable with "find /usr |
cpio -o >/dev/null" on an MD RAID1 -- but not on a single disk.
Andi suggested:
   Yes, I bet something forgets to turn on interrupts again and it's
   picked up by (and blamed on) the next guy who does an unconditional
   sti, which happens to be __do_sofitrq or idle.
That sounds right to me.
I built 2.6.16-rc5-git6 yesterday, and it still suffers from the same
issue.
