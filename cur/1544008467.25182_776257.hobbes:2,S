I see you don't call rfkill_set_default(). Do Dell firmwares support
persistent rfkill state?
My ill-informed guess is that it shouldn't hurt to call it. If the
firmware is sane, it will initialize the rfkill to a useful state.
Otherwise, the radio(s) would be unusable without the platform driver.
But do feel free to ignore me, if you suspect the firmware of insanity :).
