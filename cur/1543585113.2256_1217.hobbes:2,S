Aha.. so that's it.  I've never been able to get /linuxrc to execute
automagically.  I wonder why /linuxrc executes on Art's system, but
not on mine.  I can call it whatever I want and it doesn't run unless
I explicitly start it with init=whatever.
If it does execute though, that explains init complaining.. pid is
going to be whatever comes after the last thread started (would be
8 here).  It looks like you're only supposed to do setup things in
magic filename /linuxrc and not exec /sbin/init from there.
In any case, it looks like renaming linuxrc to whatever.sh and booting
with init=/whatever.sh instead will likely make init happy.
