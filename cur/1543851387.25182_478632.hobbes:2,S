Yes, certainly implementable, and I don't think it would complicate
the code too much. I alluded to it as a possibility when I first sent
out my patches  - I think my main issue with it was the fact that it
results in multiple container pointers per process at compile time,
which could be wasteful.

I saw your example, but can you give a concrete example of a situation
when you might want to do that?
For simplicity combined with flexibility, I think I still favour the
following model:
- all processes are a member of one container
- for each resource type, each container is either in the same
resource node as its parent or a freshly child node of the parent
resource node (determined at container creation time)
This is a subset of my more complex model, but it's pretty easy to
understand from userspace and to implement in the kernel.

Yes, if we took that model. But if someone does want to have
non-identical hierarchies, then in that model they're still forced
into a non-atomic update situation.
What objections do you have to David's suggestion hat if you want some
processes in a container to be in one resource node and others in
another resource node, then you should just subdivide into two
containers, such that all processes in a container are in the same set
of resource nodes?
