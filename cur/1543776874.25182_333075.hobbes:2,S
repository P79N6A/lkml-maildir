Well, some people don't have a choice.  They need to leave BIOS USB 
keyboard/mouse support turned on in order to use their USB keyboard/mouse 
before the Linux kernel has loaded (within Grub, for instance).
If you don't care about that, then it's cleaner to turn off the BIOS 
support.  Of course, you may find that you still need to use 
"usb-handoff" anyway!
In the end it doesn't make much difference.  Do whatever works best for 
you.
