Why do you need to move the .h files?

No reason to have two different variables assigned the same value.
If you are modifying this anyway consider something like:
machine-y               := mach-generic
machine-$(CONFIG_VISWS) := mach-visws
And then replace $(MACHINE) with $(machine-y).
This makes it much cleaner to add summit for example.

What's wrong with:
CFLAGS += -Iarch/i386/$(MACHINE_H) -Iarch/i386/mach-generic
That should achieve the same effect?
