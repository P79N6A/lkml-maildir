We changed the format of /proc/slabinfo.  Running slabtop threw up
an error message complaining that the format had changed.
It was a graceful failure, but a failure none-the-less.
Other failures have been somewhat more dramatic.
I know ipsec-tools, and alsa-lib have both caused pain
on at least one occasion after the last 2-3 kernel updates.
I was keeping track of these breakages, but I can't seem to
find the text file right now.  Bill, can you remember any
other cases worthy of mentioning ?
