It's a change in behaviour of a wide range of keyboards, and it's in a 
patch that is supposed to be fixing a single keyboard. Personally, I 
suspect that the people who are going to want the F-keys by default are 
the people who are easily able to change this behaviour and the ones who 
aren't are the ones who are going to expect their keyboard to behave 
like it did under MacOS. But that's a separate argument for a separate 
patch :)
