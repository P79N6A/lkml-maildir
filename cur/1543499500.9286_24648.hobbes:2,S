	Glad we agree.  Now how do you handle hotpluggable devices (such as
scsi drives) in userspace?  Need scsi compiled in the kernel for booting.
Compile it as a module as well?  Whoahh...  That just seems very ugly...
Notify the user space daemon that something's disappeared so it can futz
w/ /dev?  Seems like an extra unneccessary step.  That, and what permissions
would it be set to when gets created?  Need a config file, just the same
as you'd need for devfsd.
