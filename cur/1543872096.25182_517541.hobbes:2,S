I agree that it gets a bit "interesting", and one option might be that the 
"read()" interface just gets the signal number and the minimal siginfo 
information, which is, after all, what 99% of all apps actually care
about.
But "siginfo_t" is really a *horrible* structure. Nobody sane should ever 
use siginfo_t, and the designer of that thing was so high on LSD that it's 
not even funny. Re-using fields in a union? Values that depend on other 
bits in the thing in random manners? 
In other words, I bet that we could just make it a *lot* better by making 
the read structure be:
 - 16 4-byte fields (fixed 64-byte packet), where each field is an 
   uint32_t (we could even do it in network byte order if we care and if 
   you want to just pipe the information from one machine to another, but 
   that sounds a bit excessive ;)
 - Just put the fields people actually use at fixed offsets: si_signo, 
   si_errno, si_pid, si_uid, si_band, si_fd.
 - that still leaves room for the other cases if anybody ever wants them 
   (but I doubt it - things like si_addr are really only useful for 
   synchronous signals that are actually done as *signals*, since you 
   cannot defer a SIGBUS/SIGSEGV/SIGILL *anyway*).
So I bet 99% of users actually just want si_signo, while some small subset 
might want the SIGCHLD info and some of the special cases (eg we migth 
want to add si_addr as a 64-bit thing just because the USB stack sends a 
SI_ASYNCIO thing for completed URB's, so a libusb might want it, but 
that's probably the only such user).
And it would be *cleaner* than the mess that is siginfo_t..
(I realize that siginfo_t is ugly because it built up over time, using the 
same buffer for many different things. I'm just saying that we can 
probably do better by *not* using it, and just laying things out in a 
cleaner manner to begin with, which also solves any compatibility issues)
