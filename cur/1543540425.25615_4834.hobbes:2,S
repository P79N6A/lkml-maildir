Copy your 2.4.0-test5 kernel to /boot or some such.  The only
requirement here is that it resides on the root filesystem.  If you
called this kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.0-test5, then your lilo.conf entry
should look something like this.
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.0-test5
	label=test
	root=/dev/hda1
	read-only
label= can be whatever you want and root= must be set to the device
where your root filesystem lives.  After making these changes to
lilo.conf, you will need to run /sbin/lilo to actually commit the
changes.  If lilo exits with no errors, then you're done; reboot and
select "test" or whatever you called it and it will boot.
One convention I use that I find to be quite convenient is that I have
a few entries in my lilo.conf that looks like this.
image=/boot/test
        label=test
        root=/dev/hda6
        read-only
        optional
image=/boot/vmlinuz
        label=:)
        root=/dev/hda6
        read-only
I also name my kernels things like /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.0-test5-2000.08.01
so I know for sure when I built it.  Then I symlink the known working
kernel to /boot/vmlinuz and the test kernel to /boot/test.  The optional
tag in the test image makes sure that if /boot/test doesn't exist, it is
skipped over and /boot/vmlinuz becomes the new default kernel.
