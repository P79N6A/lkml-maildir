I noticed that, however I do not have the bandwitdh to track several trees
simultaneously. Will do that on a high bandwidth machine and create a diff.

This is probably it. The raw image is just a bit over 4 megs. Is there a

Size problem? At least it's not triggered by the yaboot limitation because
the image is similar in size to zImage.chrp which would be around 1.8 megs.
