In that case the reviewer should be made part of the forwarding chain,
and it should be made clear to whoever is upstream that this is a patch
that has not been modified since it was reviewed.

To a lawyer, yes. To everyone else, no, and the GPL already tells you
that you are given no warranties.
The reviewed-by tag has, as far as I understand, no legal standing:
unlike the DCE, we're not expecting anyone to be able to sue over this.
So we should at least be trying to ensure that reviewers are 'reasonably
sure' that the patch works. Otherwise, reviews will turn into yet
another coding standards witch hunt of zero value.
