Hi;
I've got 2.2.4 SMP with two CPUs running a fairly busy web server, and I'm
running into an odd problem.  When the total number of processes on the
system gets above around 170, non-root can no longer fork.  Errno is set to
EAGAIN.  The per-user process limit is 256, so obviously no one is near that
limit.
From root, I can fork to my heart's content--I have no trouble starting
up 40 or 50 root shells (that's not a limit--I get tired of typing
"sh<RETURN>" after that many).
I've got half a gig of RAM, with about 400 meg free if buffers are
subtracted out, so I don't seem to be running out of memory.
Anyone have any suggestions as to what resource I need more of?
