WHAT!? I'm sorry, but to my eyes, an unstable computer is worth nothing.
If I can't somewhat trust my machine, I'll take paper and pencil...
However, I don't see a solution towards stopping companies from making
(partially) binary-only drivers.
Maybe we'd start to put more effort into disassemblers/re-assemblers and
code-generators from disassembly dumps.
Maybe we can use a simple solution: Only allow modules that contain full
debug info :)
