I believe this patch is too complex/hazardous and may break exp decay 
computation.
(Even if nobody care about avenrun[] those days :), do you ? )
You could just change LOAD_FREQ from (5*HZ) to (5*HZ+1)
#define LOAD_FREQ   (5*HZ+1)
Mathematical proof (well... sort of)
$ cat prog.c
#define FSHIFT          11              /* nr of bits of precision */
#define FIXED_1         ((double)(1<<FSHIFT))   /* 1.0 as fixed-point */
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
printf("Old values :\n");
printf("#define EXP_1  %g\n", FIXED_1/exp(5.0/60.0));
printf("#define EXP_5  %g\n", FIXED_1/exp(5.0/(5*60.0)));
printf("#define EXP_15 %g\n", FIXED_1/exp(5.0/(15*60.0)));
printf("New values :\n");
printf("%g\n", FIXED_1/exp(5.01/60.0));
printf("%g\n", FIXED_1/exp(5.01/(5*60.0)));
printf("%g\n", FIXED_1/exp(5.01/(15*60.0)));
return 0;
}
# gcc -o prog prog.c -lm
# ./prog
Old values :
#define EXP_1  1884.25
#define EXP_5  2014.15
#define EXP_15 2036.65
New values :
1883.94
2014.08
2036.63
You can see that 5.01 instead of 5.00 second gives the same EXP_xx values.
So (5*HZ + 1) is safe. (because HZ >= 100)
