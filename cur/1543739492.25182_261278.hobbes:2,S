Subject: IO-APIC missing interrupts

I'm having some problems with the IO-APIC on a Acer Aspire 1501LMI 
laptop (AMD64). When the IO-APIC is enabled it misses some interrupts. 
Using noapic makes everything work fine.
The problem appears during fifo transfers when interrupts are frequent. 
My guess is that if a new interrupt is signaled while still in the 
interrupt handler, the new interrupt gets ignored.
The device in question is a LPC/ISA device.
Are there perhaps some special commands that need to be executed by the 
driver when on an APIC system?
