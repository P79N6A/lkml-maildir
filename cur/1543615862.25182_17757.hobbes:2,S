And, thus, we decend into more /proc crappyness.
After *lots* of discussion and months of waiting, it was decided between
Alan, David Jones, Jeff Garzik, and other affected parties that
/proc/sys/cpu/#/whatever would be a reasonable.  It has even appeared on
lkml a couple of times in the past.
Currently, there is an allocated sysctl number in include/linux/sysctl.h
for /proc/sys/cpu, and it is used by the cpufreq code to provide:
  /proc/sys/cpu/#/speed
  /proc/sys/cpu/#/speed-max
  /proc/sys/cpu/#/speed-min
However, it's true that some of that needs to be pulled out so anything
can use /proc/sys/cpu/#.  Just takes the necessary parties to get together
to do the hard work, and with the right hardware to test it out.
