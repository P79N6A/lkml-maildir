I don't think the number of concurrent ioctls 
apps might try to send is governed by number of
hba's or number of disks (which are virtualized)
or number of physical disks (which the driver doesn't
know.)  It's whatever the apps want to try to send
down.

Not much by most people, I expect. It's not in
the main i/o path, definitely.
it's used by things like our online Array Config Utility
(for configuring new volumes after adding new hardware
such as hot plugging some disks into a storage box...)
Also used by Compaq Insight Manager agents for 
monitoring.
Flashing HBA firmware...

no.
