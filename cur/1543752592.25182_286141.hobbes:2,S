Andrew:
How serious are people about continuing to support versions of gcc prior 
to 3.0?  My copy of RedHat's gcc-2.96 croaks without this patch:

For changes involving code that's not executed very often I wouldn't
hesitate to recommend adopting such a patch.  Does sys_getdents64() fall
in that category?  Also I'm not sure how much extra overhead is added by
calling put_user() rather than __put_user().
So I'll leave it up to you to decide whether the patch should be applied.
