I don't know guasi at all, but libaio requires O_DIRECT to be async. I'm
sure you know this, but you may not know that fio default to buffered IO
so you have to tell it to use O_DIRECT :-)
So try adding a --direct=1 (or --buffered=0, same thing) as an extra
option when comparing depths > 1.
I'll add your guasi engine, but disable it. Unfortunately fio still
doesn't have a nifty configure setup, so these things are still
manual...
