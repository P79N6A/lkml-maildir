Ehh? The same ones you allow to write all over the raw device?
Let's see now:
	brw-rw----    1 root     disk       3,   0 Jan 30  2003 /dev/hda
would you put people you don't trust with your disk in the "disk" group?
Right. If you trust somebody enough that you give him write access to the 
disk, then you might as well trust him enough to do commands on it. 
Conversely, if you don't trust him enough to do things like that, you 
shouldn't give him write access in the first place.
It's a hell of a lot easier to destroy a disk with
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/xxx bs=8k
than it is to do it with some special malicious command. 
And yes, there's clearly a difference, but in general I'd say it is the 
_data_ on the disk that is worth something to you. The disk itself? Do you 
really fundamentally care?
