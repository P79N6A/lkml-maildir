I meant to reply to Luben's original, but I deleted it in disgust.
As the person who converted SCSI from the old bottom-half completion
processing first to a tasklet and then to a softirq, I'd like to refute
at least part of this allegation.  I didn't do it in order to improve
SCSI particularly, satisfy Splentec (who are they?), or prove a point.
I did it because I wanted to remove the old bottom-half mechanism and
SCSI was one of the remaining users.  That required me to learn a bit
about the SCSI stack and I got sucked in.  BTW, I believe at that time,
James had alreeady taken over maintenance.  I'm not actually sure who
the previous maintainer was -- was it Eric Biederman?
A colleague asked me to summarise the current dispute.  I said that
Luben's point was that nobody else understood SCSI.  Everybody else's
point was that Luben doesn't understand Linux kernel development.  Luben,
I think you need to shut up, accept advice, stop trying to do everything
in your own driver, and stop trying to have private conversations.
Just discuss things on linux-scsi dispassionately.  There's no hidden
agenda to get you or your company.  But you are pissing people off,
and very soon there *will* be because of your behaviour.
