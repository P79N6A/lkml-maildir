I also have such a problem with 2.3.99-pre2-4, pre2-2 worked fine, but now
the computer freeze while stopping Squid 2.2STABLE5 on shutdown.
And, while compiling or menuconfiging Kernel >= 2.3.99-pre1 (not with
2.3.51 or 2.2.15pre14), there are lots of these messages:
/bin/sh: invalid character 45 in exportstr for DRIVERS-y
/bin/sh: invalid character 45 in exportstr for DRIVERS-
/bin/sh: invalid character 45 in exportstr for DRIVERS-m
/bin/sh: invalid character 45 in exportstr for DRIVERS-n
