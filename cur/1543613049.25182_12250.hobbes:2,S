This looks like it could end up being a FAQ. Hence a new entry:

Are people still searching for reds under the bed? It's getting pretty
hard to find a communist these days. I'm surprised and amused when I
still hear people using this old term of vilification. Get with the
times, dude! You're now supposed to use the terms "child molester",
"child pornographer", and, to be really hip, "terrorist". What's the
fun in using a term when it doesn't have the same emotional impact?

Oh, stop being rational! It's so much less fun.

Indeed. This has been stated on a number of occasions.

And this too has been discussed. I wish people would read the archives
(or even the FAQ) before flaming. But why let facts stand in the way
of a good flame^H^H^H^H^Htroll?

Not that Linux is trying to shut out proprietary drivers, but if you
believe in the right of a developer to distribute code under a
restrictive proprietary licence, you'd be a hypocrite to suggest that
developers shouldn't distribute under a strict GPL licence. Freedom of
choice means that I get to do things that *I* want but *you* don't.
Or perhaps you just want freedom to control *my* choice?
