Hello,
We already have a sample at:
http://wiki.tuxonice.net/EncryptedSwapAndRoot
It stores the keys of mounted partitions on an encrypted swap, which
has the same encryption with different keyset.
It also shows how to resume from encrypted swap, And you can
optionally store the keys on hardware device such as smartcards.
Best Regards,
Alon Bar-Lev
