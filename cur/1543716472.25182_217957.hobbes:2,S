Hi
We're trying to use the workqueue interface for scheduling a delayed 
gargage collector.
Since we only need a single delayed thread we used the DECLEARE_WORK macro.
The problem is that once we call cancel_delayed_work we can't schedule 
work again.
Having looked at the code i noticed that cancel_delayed_work only 
deletes the timer but
doesn't set clear the "pending" bit, thus any call to 
schedule_delayed_work is ignorred.
Example:
static DECLARE_WORK(tft, timeoutfun, NULL)
.
.
.
schedule_delayed_work(&tft, 1*HZ);
cancel_delayed_work(&tft);
<do some work>
tft.pending = 0;   / / if we dont clear pending no work can be scheduled
schedule_delayed_work(&tft, 1*HZ);
return 0;
End example
Setting tft.pending is a rather ugly solution - shouldn't it be cleared by
cancel_delayed_work?, or are we using the interface in the wrong way?
Cheers
    Mikkel
