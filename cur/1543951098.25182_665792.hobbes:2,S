Faulting on the child's (non-)copy of the parent's VM_LOCKED vma.
Yes, but did you realize that VM_LOCKED is cleared from the child's
vma (the "vma" in that code sample above happens to be the parent's)?
Though an area is locked in the parent, that's not carried over to the
child.

It would be possible, but I don't think it would be justified - for
everybody who wants your behaviour, there'll be others who want the
current behaviour (and that condition reflects those cases on which
correctness demands we do the copy).
If you really want that, I think you'll have to patch your own kernel.
But much much better, mlock that area in your child after the fork,
since it isn't actually locked at present: that mlock will bring in
the pages - not quite as efficiently as copy_page_range would have done,
but as or more efficiently than the original mlock in the parent.
