Won't it die in the kernel with an oops on the next interrupt?

Are you sure this handles interrupts or nested syscalls 
before the context switch correctly?
I think it really needs to be handled in the sysenter path.

It doesn't task switch, but you would get a #GP in IRET at least.
Leaking that to another process is definitely not good.

We used to do that pushfl/popfl some time ago, but Ben removed it because
it was slow on P4.  Ok, nobody thought of that case back then.
