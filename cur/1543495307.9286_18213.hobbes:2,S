I dont think it would be hard. At least no harder than the other
blacklists in the kernel (e.g. ide-dma.c, scsi). Where we would override
the geometry from the drive or BIOS when we *know* it to be reported
wrong. Or at least give some warning, like with the recent drive which
reported 15 heads instead of 16, and had a jumper for it.
Of course, you can still manually send in CHS on the kernel boot
parameter, but it's nice to have it done automatically when we know
better. Thats why we have blacklists in the first place, to eliminate
guessing and enormously long kernel boot parameters.
