Hi all,
sometimes I get the following messages:
hdc: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
		  hdc: drive_cmd: error=0x04
		  hdc: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
		  hdc: drive_cmd: error=0x04
I can find it also in the dmesg output.
What do they mean?
Please cc' me, I'm not a subscriber of the list.
