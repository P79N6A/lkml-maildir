Under SCO UnixWare 7.1.1 you can happily write to devices in a readonly
mounted (vxfs) filesystem. You can also happily access(W_OK) them. Just
tried, right now (ok, it should have been obvious from the src but I trust
my hands more than my eyes :)
If I read the src right, AIX 4.3 and Monterey64 should do the same. OSR504
looks the same but Hugh knows it a lot better than me (he wrote most of
it!) so I defer to him to verify.
