There actually is another way pages can move, with both
get_user_pages() and mlock(): copy-on-write after a fork().  If
userspace does a fork(), then all PTEs are marked read-only, and if
the original process touches the page after the fork(), a new page
will be allocated and mapped at the original virtual address.
This is actually a pretty big pain, because the only good solution
seems to be for the kernel to mark these registered regions as
VM_DONTCOPY.  Right now this means that driver code ends up monkeying
with vm_flags for user vmas.
Does it seem reasonable to add a new system call to let userspace mark
memory it doesn't want copied into forked processes?  Something like
	long sys_mark_nocopy(unsigned long addr, size_t len, int mark)
which would set VM_DONTCOPY if mark != 0, and clear it if mark == 0.
A better name would be gratefully accepted...
Then to register memory for RDMA, userspace would call
sys_mark_nocopy() (with appropriate accounting to handle possibly
overlapping regions) and the kernel would call get_user_pages().  The
get_user_pages() is of course required because the kernel can't trust
userspace to keep the pages locked.  mlock() would no longer be
necessary.  We can trust userspace to call sys_mark_nocopy() as
needed, because a process can only hurt itself and its children by
misusing the sys_mark_nocopy() call.
If this seems reasonable then I can code a patch.
