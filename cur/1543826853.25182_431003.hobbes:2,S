It's uncoventional that a work struct is re-initialized on the fly.
IMO, it's better to introduce a flag indicating the stream is already
running and use a single function/work struct.  For example,
	static void do_first_event(struct stream *str)
	{
		...
		str->running = 1;
	}
	static void do_more_event(struct stream *str)
	{
		...
	}
	static void work_event(void *data)
	{
		struct stream *str = data;
		if (str->running)
			do_more_event(str);
		else
			do_first_event(str);
	}
	trigger_start()
	{
		queue_work(queue, &this_work);
	}
	interrupt_handler()
	{
		...
		queue_work(queue, &this_work);
		...
	}
	initialization()
	{
		...
		queue = create_workqueue("xxx");
		INIT_WORK(&this_work, work_event, str);
		...
	}
