It is not necessary. I will fix it in the next version.

Yes, that is nicer. I will fix it.

All "preserve" registers defined in ABI are saved, I think that is
sufficient. The "swsusp_arch_suspend" saves only these registers too.
An extensible inter-kernel kjump protocol and corresponding version
number seems sensible. I will work on this.

Before and after "machine_kexec_jump" is called, the
save_processor_state() and restore_processor_state() are called, where
the MTRR/FPU/GDT/IDT/TR/segments/cr are saved and restored. These two
functions come from swsusp. Thanks swsusp guys. :)
