The typeof() cast looks weird. I had to think twice to make sense of it.

/proc does it by increasing the count in the struct page of the stack
page of the process. exit() knows about that. Example is somewhere in fs/proc/
The increase has to be done inside the lock. As always one has to be careful
with lock ordering.
The standard way is to just hold the read lock of the tasklist.
