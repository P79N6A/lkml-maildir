Subject: stupid question about netlink and 2.6.14 and latest udev

Latest udev says that it requires netlink support in the kernel, however I 
can't find any concrete info on how to enable netlink in 2.6.14+ .. a grep of 
NETLINK in .config doesn't find anything. I saw an option that made reference 
to netlink, but it didn't actually state that it was enabling netlink. What's 
the magic config option? Or how does one check if a running kernel has 
netlink support functional?
thanks!

I'm not worried. If there's something bad out there we'll find, you'll slay, 
we'll party!
