Daemons that I've written for linux-specific tasks all 
use the select timeout in order to wait for an event for a fixed
amount of time, across possible interrupts.
That is to say, they watch the errno after return from select, and if
it was EINTR, then they reenter the select without further ado.
Since the timeout has changed to reflect the time remaining, that's
quite right.
This is typical of deamons doing tcp/ip. I guess one answer would be to
make tcp timeout more configurable.
