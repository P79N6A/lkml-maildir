We should distinguish kernel tainting and module tainting.  Kernel
tainting affects the stack dumps.  Module tainting affects access to
GPL-only symbols.
Kernel tainting for "ndiswrapper" is in the code already.  The patch I'm
complaining about is replacing kernel tainting with both kinds of
tainting.
Of course, ndiswrapper could taint itself as a module, but it would be a
purely symbolic act, since the module would be loaded already, and the
GPL-only symbols resolved.
