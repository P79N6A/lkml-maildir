i've only tested on 2005ish Ahlon64_UP@k8T800: it doesn't need any of the quirks
  IOAPIC_POSTFLUSH, sis_bug, level-edge cleanup.
IOAPIC_POSTFLUSH caused no negative influence neither.
i've an io_apic_one.c here, that doesn't have any of the quirks and is stripped down
to handle just one ioapic. It runs just fine on PREEMPT_RT.
Could be used as a "Do i crash/suffer without the quirks?" test for 1 ioapic equipped machines.
Should i post it?
On vanilla level-interrupts behave "nervously" showing the "doubled rate" effect:
For level interrupts vanilla just sends an EOI to the apic. Nothing else should be necessary (io)apic wise.
Only here, when the edge-level triggered hardware-handler acknowledges its client
(== resets the interrupt line) the doubled level interrupt is triggered on the same pin.
Thus the same interrupt routine runs again as soon as EOI has been sent and IFlag is open again.
hardware-handler receives it, does nothing and returns with "uninterested" <<insert correct macro here<.
everything works correctly though. its just some cycles wasted.
Odd, no? I found that the correct interrupt handling can be achieve by obeying the PREEMPT_RT method:
	level-interrupt triggers
		ioapic pin is masked
			harware-handler deasserts pin/line
		apic gets eoi
		ioapic pin is unmasked
this could be optimized by ioapic caching , but there must be some configuration tweak......
that i don't know of. there are no via docs for me. erm.. anybody sends me a link _offlist_ ?-)
Or even _knows that tweak_ ?
And again IOAPIC_POSTFLUSH has no influence here on the doubled interrupt (VIA K8T800 only ?)
bug.
