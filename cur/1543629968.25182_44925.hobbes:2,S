   Fine with me if Marcelo drops it, but I guess sparc/m68k/mips users
   won't like not be able to use 2.4 kernels anymore unless they first
   rewrite the entere cache flushing in the middle of a stable series.
   If you don't drop it in late 2.4 then my suggestion looks still a nice
   common code cleanup and it's functional equivalent to the current
   2.4.19pre8 code, so it cannot go wrong.
I only suggest doing it for 2.5, repeat, only 2.5
And yes adding the flush_page_to_ram call in filemap_nopage was a bug
fix in 2.4.10.  I believe it was from one of the SH port maintainers.
