Wouldn't surprise me if it's an X problem... I can't say that I feel
like going digging into X sources...
I can get the same problem in sawfish if I press the key a few times
quite rapidly as well, without any background load at all. This problem
has never occured before on 2.4 or 2.5, with or without load. It could
be that the scheduler changes exposes some bug in X but I'm not really
sure how to start investigating...

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
