Getting some real memory bandwidth data out of it would be interesting
for tracking the proble.  By the time you get to pipe bandwidth the
fact you changed kernels could easily have an effect.
I think LMbench has the equivalent of streams in it so those would be useful.

The PII bus has 64 data pins and transfers data over them at the processor
FSB clock rate.  So the processor maximums look something like:
66Mhz  528MB/s
100Mhz 800MB/s
133Mhz 1064MB/s
The data bus for SDRAM happens to follow the same rules, except the
address for the data also happens to go over the data bus, which gives
the processor a small advantage, in pure bandwidth.  The biggest hit
SDRAM takes from protocol overhead is when either (a) you don't burst 
or (b) you are doing back to back reads and writes.  Writes go into
the SDRAM pipeline immediately but reads can't come out of the
pipeline immediately.
And you were getting at most 1/5th of the theoretical which looks
ugly.  Not that I have seen the PII core get close to it's bus
potential except under special conditions.

Have you verified that the MTRR's are enabled on your memory?  I
suppose there could also be a bad memory controller setting as well.
You might be able to look at the at the linuxBIOS code and see if
your BIOS is doing something different.
