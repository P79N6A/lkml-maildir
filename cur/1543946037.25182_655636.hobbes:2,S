> 1) you are accessing dev->link_mode and tb[] outside the dev_base_lock 
yes, because tb[IFLA_LINKMODE] is not used by someone else in this case 
only dev->link_mode. Although its value is unpredictable in case of a 
concurrent access in the condition, it does not affect the final value 
of dev->link_mode but the length of the critical section remains 
minimal. The if statement may be inside the lock.

Indeed:
"Feb 16 16:51:49 sandman kernel: BUG: rwlock recursion on CPU#0,"
I missed it. I copied the code from another patch which didn't contain 
the two locking statements and when I copied them back it became a 
copy-paste bug.

That's bad. Does my suggestion solve the problem? Again:
-      if (modified)
-                 netdev_state_change(dev);
+      if (modified && dev->flags & IFF_UP)
+                 call_netdevice_notifiers(NETDEV_CHANGE, dev)
