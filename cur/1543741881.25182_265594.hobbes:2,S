I already did, I just keep procrastinating. Better is an enemy of good.
I wanted to adopt 2.6 style refcounting, because there's a possibility
of oops lurking in 2.4 code. That would move the hangup call into the
close/release path.
The top part of V. Ganesh's patch with a missing initialization you already
have in -rc1. The bottom part Robert's patch covers (modulo the relocation
of the whole fragment).
I'll make a better 2.6 style patch as soon as I can. Maybe today even.
