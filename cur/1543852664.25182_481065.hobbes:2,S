Sure that is reasonable, if correct.

I am not certain that is incorrect.  roundup(sizeof(elf note header), 4) +
roundup(n_namesize, 4) will yield something that is properly 4 byte aligned.
I do agree that implementation is not correct for 8 byte alignment.  8 byte
alignment does not appear to be in widespread use in the wild.

Sure that is clearly an issue.

Sure.
To verify your claim that 8 byte alignment is correct I checked the
core dump code in fs/binfmt_elf.c in the linux kernel.  That always
uses 4 byte alignment.  Therefore it appears clear that only doing
4 byte alignment is not a local misreading of the spec, and is used in
other implementations.  If you can find an implementation that uses
8 byte alignment I am willing to consider it.
The current situation is that the linux kernel generated application
core dumps use 4 byte alignment so I expect that is what existing
applications such as gdb expect.
Therefore we use 4 byte alignment unless it can be shown that the
linux core dumps are a fluke and should be fixed.
