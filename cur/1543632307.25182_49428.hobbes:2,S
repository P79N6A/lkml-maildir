Ok, by mistake I made it 2.5.19 dependant (to compile), it is fixed now.
I've just copied pci_ids.h and errno-base.h from kernel to atapci/ dir.
So 0.51 version is here:
http://home.elka.pw.edu.pl/~bzolnier/atapci/atapci-0.51.tar.bz2
changelog:
- make it kernel version independent
- add '-s' strip flag to CFLAGS
- minor cosmetics by Roberto Nibali
