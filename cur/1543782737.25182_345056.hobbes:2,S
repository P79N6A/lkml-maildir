Are you deliberately trying to be annoying?   Let me guess:
  - your under 25 years of age, probably in high school or not far
    out of it
  - you have a stupid oversized wanky computer case with neon
    lighting and useless analog dials and what not.  you might have
    even overclocked it
  - you've run windows most of your live
  - you probably run gentoo now.  you like the feeling of having
    everything optimized for your exact system; the addition 0.25%
    speed increase more than offsets the fact everything is crappy
    and crashes all the time
  - you run reiserfs, you probably can't wait till reiser4 is merged
    so you can run that
  - you're very interesting in real-time patches.  linux should
    clearly have all real-time stuff merged.  second to your interest
    in realtime is probably something like selinux
  - if you drive a car, it has extra spoilers added and you've
    replaced the steering wheel with something from MOMO
  - you 'friends' are worried you'll die a virgin
Please.
How about you do a little research on some things for a bit?  The
initramfs code is done the way it is for a good reason.  cpio is used
over tar for another good reason.
You are most welcome to disagree and even voice you disagreement, but
there comes a point where you really need to produce some better
arguments.  Patches wouldn't hurt either.
