I like this policy and understand how to use it, except...
Once upon a time I wrote a program which used O_NOFOLLOW, before Glibc
had support for that flag.
It had to read the kernel headers, as this macro is an
architecture-dependent flag, and I did not want to write a program that
was so non-portable it would only compile on some architectures.
Even if I'd copied all the definitions for all architectures out of the
kernel, that wouldn't do: the program wouldn't compile on architectures
added later, or ones that aren't part of the standard distribution.
So to keep the program relatively portable, it searched for definitions
of O_NOFOLLOW in the kernel headers.  (It was a Glibc/kernel conflict
nightmare).
Please can you suggest how I should write this sort of code, the next
time it occurs?
thanks,
