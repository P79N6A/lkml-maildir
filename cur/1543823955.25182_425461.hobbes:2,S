A better question is, why can't we have both?
I don't have unlimited memory and disk.  I need to conserve my
resources as much as possible.
The one-kernel approach saves memory, leaving more for applications.
That's important to me.  I don't need to run multiple kernels, and I
don't want to.  I only want multiple secure operating environments.
The one-kernel approach also makes it easy to have all VPS in one disk
partition, without the performance penalty of file backed I/O.
If the VM approach is truly less risky, seems to me the Xen/VMware
developers should be able to succeed independently, despite changes
made for in-kernel virtualization.
I'm glad someone asked a question I could answer.  :-)
