if you're using AWARD or INSYDE BIOS, it might be a bug of BIOS.
updating the BIOS might help.
on some AWARD BIOS, this may have been already fixed on the latest
ALSA via82xx driver (or maybe not :)  if the latest one still doesn't
work, please try to add dxs_support=2 or dxs_support=3 option, which
disable DXS channels or use 48kHz only.

it's a bug of configure script of alsa-driver package, the machine
header files was not added in the include path.  i'll fix it.
