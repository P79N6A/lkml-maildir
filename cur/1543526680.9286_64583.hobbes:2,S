Subject: [Patch] Optimize entry.S and hw_irq.h

Hi Yall,
some time ago (in the times of 2.0) I was stumbling across some assembly
lines, which didn't look too optimised, regarding, that they seem to be
rather time-critical.
Well, I took a second look and quickly came up with some optimisation,
which should at least make my P133 (w/o MMX) happier.
It runs stable and feels a LoT faster ,-]]] (*just joking*)
Anyway, it might help, so feel free to comment or improve.
Now, on to the patch:
The Macro in entry.S was calling cld, which cannot pair on P5, since
most of the time, the macro was called after another value was pushed on
to the stack, I chose to take cld out of the way after the pushes, in
order to let those pair.
Then, I'm not to happy with 
mov $(__KERNEL_DS), %edx; 
since %edx is pushed only 2 cycles above, as well as choosing %ebx for
the kernel segment...
Well, but since in the most critical path (I believe) it was used in
conjunction with the macro GET_CURRENT, I chose to come up with a new
macro, SAVE_ALL_GET_CURRENT, which would do both, just interleaved to
better fill the pipes of the Pentium.
Then of course, the two macros where exchanged by the new one later on.
In hw_irq.h, only the cld was moved towards the end of the macro, for
the very same reasons.
This alone should save 2 cycles on Pplain.
If You have suggestions, I'd be more than happy to hear about them, but
please CC, since I'm not subscribed to LKML.
Greetings,
raY
