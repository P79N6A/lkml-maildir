> Eh? Why are you now suddenly changing your tune from when I wrote a fix
Rusty said that one fix was causing oopses.  And he caught me in a
weak moment - so I didn't challenge him on that assertion.
Yes I would prefer to limit changes in this code to what's actually
breaking other code here and now.
As soon as I can get the latest 2.6.6-rc2-mm2 to build various
arch's and merge with this stuff, I will be ready to request
Andrew's attention once again.
