It tells the compiler that memory was, or is about to be, modified.
Therefore, the complier must put back into memory anything it
was caching, and after the barrier, it must re-read anything it
uses from memory. It, itself, generates no code, but the compiler
will usually spew out some 'extra' instructions as a result of
this, so it isn't a "nop".
