Hi, 
patch looks good, but here is yet another thing to test.
We need to know base baudrate of this card. I failed to find 
HT6552 datasheet on Holtek site, so we need another experiment.
You can test it this way:
1) connect one port of this card with normal serial port or any 
   serial device with known baudrate;
2) test data transfer, if it fails try to set lower speed on PCI card's port.
3) if you found needed speed, calculate base baudrate
 <base baudrate> = (<speed of normal port> / <speed of PCI card port>) * 115200
Good luck.
