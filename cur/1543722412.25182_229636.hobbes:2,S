Hmm... OK, I see that you have an active multiplexing controller.
I wonder if it gets reset back to legacy mode when you plug your
external keyboard. (btw, it it just a keyboard or a docking station/
port replicator?). Try passing i8042.nomux to the kernel and try using
your touchpad/keyboard. If nomux does not help you may try to use
psmouse.proto=bare or psmouse.proto=imps to disable Synaptics-specific
extensions.
Also, if you have time, please change #undef DEBUG to #define DEBUG in
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c, reboot, play a bit with touchpad; plug
external keyboard and send me output of "dmesg -s 100000".

Ok, we were getting reports about this happening with Toshibas, no
resolution yet...
