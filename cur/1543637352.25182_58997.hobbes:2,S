Yup, looks familiar.
The thing is, we cannot change existing select semantics, and the question 
is whether what most soft-realtime wants is actually select, or whether 
people really want a "waittimeofday()".
Like your example, the only uses I've had personally (DVD playback) have
really had an empty select, so it wasn't really select itself that was 
horribly important.
