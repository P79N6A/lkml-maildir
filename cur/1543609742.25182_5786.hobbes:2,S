PAE mode increases the size of the page table entries to 64-bits, and
the x86 doesn't do 64-bit operations very well.  Plus it has three
levels of tables to work with instead of two.  It is the only way to
support more than 4GB of memory so it's a tradeoff between high memory
support and performance.  If you have less memory, don't run a PAE
kernel.
