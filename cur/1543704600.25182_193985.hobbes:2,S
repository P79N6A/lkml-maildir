Version 2.6.5 of perfctr, the Linux performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
Version 2.6.5, 2004-01-26
- Relaxed and corrected control checks on Pentium 4:
  * Allow ESCR.CPL_T1 to be non-zero when using global-mode
    counters on HT processors.
  * Don't require ESCR.CPL_T0 to be non-zero. CPL_T0==0b00
    is safe and potentially useful (global counters on HT).
  * Require CCCR.ACTIVE_THREAD==0b11 on non-HT processors, as
    documented in the IA32 Volume 3 manual. Old non-HT P4s
    seem to work Ok for all four values, but this is neither
    guaranteed nor useful.
- Per-process counters driver updated for filp->f_mapping
  change in 2.6.2-rc kernels.
- Support 2.4.21-9.EL (RHEL3) and 2.4.22-1.2149.nptl (FC1) kernels.
- Library updates for PowerPC:
  * Added cpu_type constants for struct perfctr_info.
  * Decode PVR and define perfctr_info.cpu_type accordingly.
  * Added event set descriptions for 604/604e/750.
