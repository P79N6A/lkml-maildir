The graphic engine (i810) simply doesn't switch back to text mode.
Yes, 0x10 helps. I've attached a little patch that does this in a
relatively safe way. (Alternative, one could also use set_80x25,
but I think always forcing mode 3 is slightly more reliable.
Except for MGA users, of course :-)
If you get a new boot loader type code from Peter Anvin, this
should even be good enough for inclusion into the mainstream
kernel. Alternatively, we could also pick a new loader flag to
indicate that the firmware didn't initialize the system.

I see. Perhaps you could say then that mkelfImage fixes flaws in
the vmlinux ELF image meta-data, or such:

ftp://ftp.lnxi.com/pub/mkelfImage/mkelfImage-1.17.tar.gz
This sounds more like "if I kick it here, it usually works,
but I have no idea why" :-)
And yes, if it's not too intrusive, fixing the ELF meta-data
along with the addition of kexec might be a good idea.
