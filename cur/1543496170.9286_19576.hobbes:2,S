Wouldn't 2.3 be a really good place to switch to a newer compiler? there
have been two releases
of egcs since 2.7.2. (compared to kernels it is like asking people to
use 1.2, after all egcs IS
the new gcc now, even officially). I don't remember sticking to a
compiler this long before,
AFAIK we just used the most recent gcc until gcc 2.7.2 came around.
