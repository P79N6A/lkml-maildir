This information is for user land applications to have the knowledge of
which virtual ranges are getting actively used and which are not.
This information then can be fed into a new system call
sys_change_page_activation(pid, start_va, len, flag).  The purpose of
this system call would be to give hints to kernel that certain physical
pages are okay to be inactivated (or vice versa).
