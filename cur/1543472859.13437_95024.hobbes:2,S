If I understand this correctly, this prevents the selection of _both_ BIOS
and DIRECT. I don't know if choice allows a 3-way choice (no kernel-source
at hand) but 
 +  choice '   PCI support type'   		\
 +	"BIOS		CONFIG_PCI_BIOS		\
 +	 Direct		CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT    	\
 +       Both           ?????????????"   BIOS
(With appropriate ??????) would solve this problem.
