I believe it could be the same problem. Jan-Frode's system has all 
ZONE_NORMAL
memory used up. The free memory would be highmem which would be unsuable for
those allocations that are causing OOM.
The vfs_cache_pressure change could possibly be responsible for the 
problem...
I don't have the code in front of me, but I think it divides by 100 
first, then
multiplies by vfs_cache_pressure. I wouldn't have thought this would 
have such
a large impact though.
