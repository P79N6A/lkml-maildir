The patch brought my test box to the same speed as 2.4.  With the deadline
scheduler it was a bit faster than 2.4.  I didn't do a lot of testing
though.  I was using ext2.  Please try deadline.

Of course...
Tuning work is being done on the anticipatory scheduler which we hope will
bring it up to deadline throughput for this sort of workload.

Don't know yet.  On 2.6 the test actually does about 5% fewer reads than
under 2.4, so the VM page replacement is working a bit better in this case.
 And 2.6 does about 40% fewer context switches for some reason.  So we
should be a little bit faster - it's a matter of finding where the
additional seeks or idle time are coming from.
