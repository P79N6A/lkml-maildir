Certainly over an hour seems a little excessive:
$ time dd bs=512 count=1  if=/dev/sda4 of=/dev/null
dd: reading `/dev/sda4': Input/output error
0+0 records in
0+0 records out
real    67m59.382s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.002s
bash-2.05b# time mount /dev/sda4 /u4
/dev/sda4: Input/output error
mount: you must specify the filesystem type
real    71m59.322s
