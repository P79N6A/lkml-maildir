Mine too (until recently).  A proper patch to remove the limit, and copy
the args into swappable memory as they go (to avoid DoS) would be nicer,
but a quick change to MAX_ARG_PAGES seemed so much easier :-)
In my case, it was a Makefile generating the huge command lines.  There
were about 20000 source files and 80000 target files, and the occasional
long line "update the archive with these changed files: ..." ;-)
Splitting the file name list seemed so much more difficult.  You can't
even do "echo $(FILES) | xargs", as the "echo" command line is too long!
