Subject: [2.4][2.5][Trivial Patch] Bug in i386/kernel/process.c?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I was poking into how to force a warm boot (found it easily enough) and
started reading process.c, where the details live.
We have:
static int reboot_mode;
int reboot_thru_bios;
static int __init reboot_setup(char *str)
{
...set reboot_mode/reboot_thru_bios according to reboot=...
}
__setup("reboot=", reboot_setup);
Farther down:
        /* Write 0x1234 to absolute memory location 0x472.  The BIOS
reads
           this on booting to tell it to "Bypass memory test (also warm
           boot)".  This seems like a fairly standard thing that gets
set by
           REBOOT.COM programs, and the previous reset routine did this
           too. */
                                                                                
        *((unsigned short *)0x472) = reboot_mode;
                                                                                (similar code farther down in !reboot_thru_bios)
....but reboot_mode doesn't seem to be initialized if you don't set it
via reboot=...? (Same for reboot_thru_bios)
A simple patch to use the defaults (according to the code comments) is
below; if this is right please push accordingly:
Its against 2.4 but should apply to 2.5 as well.
