Actually the Commit numbers are far more interesting and here you have 
difference of 56% you haven't explained.
A large number of CVS commits are really also single BK commits (let's say 
30%, I have to leave the verification to you, but I don't think I'm that 
far of), that would leave 70% of BK commits merged into 32% of CVS 
commits. These 70% can't be extracted anymore as a single logical change 
from CVS.
The only reason this number isn't worse is that the kernel development is 
still quite serial, e.g. most of the patches sent by Andrew show up as a 
single commit, but the more people use bk the worse these numbers get.

I can play with numbers too...

You're only telling half of the story and I'm afraid you'll get away with 
it, because most people don't really know the topic that well and I can't 
blame them.
