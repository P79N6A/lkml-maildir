 There was some discussion on this list about some machine which would not wake-up
correctly if slow A20 was not closed, long time ago. I did not really follow
the code after that discussion.
 I wonder if you should do a "outb(0xFF, 0x64);" after "outb(0xdf, 0x60);" like
the HIMEM.SYS driver, to force an immediate update of the I/O ports - I think
I also read that in this initial chip docs, long time ago also.

 That is on Trident cards, old card but may still be used, and BIOS may have
been copied to other cards.

 strange, "g" would mean anything can go there - and this assembly instruction
should accept every access modes.
