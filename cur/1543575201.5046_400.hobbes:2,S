No amount of warnings can prevent morons from f**king up. Unix gives
you enough rope et al. I'm not arguing for removal of any warning, but
seriously, if we have a loud (DANGEROUS) warning in the config-system
aaaaaand a warning in the help-text that the write-support probably will
mess up your fs, how much more can you do? I bet that if we remove the
config-option, people will still enable it manually, then go "Waaaaa,
your stupid kernel messed up my filesystem, Linux sucks!"
But I kind of liked the
Enable write support (DANGEROUS)
  Really enable write support (DANGEROUS)
    Are you f**king nuts?!
approach anyway. A strong candidate for Rik van Riel's patch-of-the-month
homepage.
