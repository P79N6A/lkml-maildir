If the inode doesn't change upon a write, the system is still POSIX,
so nothing breaks (the problem is, cowlinks would be very useful, and
POSIX is very useful - making them incompatible would be a major
bummer)
If you use sendfile() or cowcp() or similar to implement cowlinks,
then only rsync/tar/cp need be taught about its usage. Someone
mentioned that diff will not be optimal with different inodes, because
diff compared inodes. So add some diffstat() that keeps track of some
magical inode like thingy that stays the same for cowed files. Then
teach diff to use diffstat().
Now, you have a system where if your program doesn't explicitly use
cowcp() and diffstat(), everything still works perfectly (we want to
still be able to use old coreutils on a machine that has a new kernel
applied, right? And vice-versa?). All that happens is that your
program may or may not be sub-optimal - you might have to compare
entire files instead of just inodes. Or you may have to copy entire
files instead of just cowing them. But it all still Just Works.
