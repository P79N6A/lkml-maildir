I think you know that better than me.
But is there homogeneity in probability ?
I mean, if the guest has a lot I/O, it is interrupted by them and the
probability to be interrupted by a tick is lower than the time passed in the VCPU ?

System time and User time are wrong too as the tick is accounted to the side
where it appears, even if CPU has executed code from the other side in a
sub-part of the tick. It's not a good argument.
