The two different uses of the superblock lock are really quite
different; I don't see any particular problem with using two different
locks for the two different things.  Mount and the namespace code are
not locking the same thing --- the fact that the resize code uses the
superblock lock is really a historical side-effect of the fact that we
used to use the same overloaded superblock lock in the ext2/ext3 block
allocation layers to guard bitmap access.
