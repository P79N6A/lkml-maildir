Well ... /dev/ide/host1 wouldn't be correct since the ATA floppy *is* the
secondary master drive (normally hdc). I noticed after awhile that if I
created a hdc node and interacted with it devfs would automagically
realize a device was actually there and create
/dev/ide/host0/bus1/target0/lun0/disc. But only after I manually touch
the drive, with a disk in, with a device node. (I just did dd if=/dev/hdc
of=/dev/null bs=1 count1)
