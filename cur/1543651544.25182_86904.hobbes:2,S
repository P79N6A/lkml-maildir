And i'd still keep environ seperate.  I'm inclined to think
ps should never have presented it in the first place.
This is the direction i (for what it's worth) favor.

Yep, can't hold the lock across syscalls.  That would be
quite a bit of data to hold in a per fd buffer.  Think of
the big iron with tons of processes.
The other way i could see this working is to present it as a
sparse file.  ps (or whatever) would first get a list of
pids then iterate over them using lseek to set the file
offset to pid * CONSTANT_SIZE and read would return
something smaller than CONSTANT_SIZE bytes.  If the pid no
longer exists return 0.
I really hate this idea.  It stinks almost as much as
/dev/kmem.
