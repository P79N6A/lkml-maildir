So make up a benchmark that can be tested with a _system_call_.
Not something that requires a filesystem that cannot exist in real life.

Yes.
The other way to say the same thing is
	"Doing it from user space might show that it's not a performance
	 optimization that cna be noticed".

If it makes you feel any better, I would have hated "sphlist" even more.
Basically, I think it's the wrong level of abstraction. If it is
abstracted like a list, then I like the current lists more that do not
need conditionals in many of the common operations. If it were to be
abstraced as a hash thing, then I might like it.
Something like "hash_insert()" and "hash_remove()" etc would be
acceptable, but then you'd need to really make the abstraction layer
higher (ie implement some form of generic "hash_find()" etc). This might
well be worthwhile - I suspect there is quite a lot of common code in
inode/page/dentry hashing, and at that point the interface would be _more_
than "just another list implementation". 
I do not like two pieces of code that basically do the equivalent thing,
is what I guess I'm saying. I prefer simplicity over something that cannot
even be measured on the performance side..
