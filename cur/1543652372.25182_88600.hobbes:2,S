Looks good to me.
We'd still need to go back and yank out the #ifdef CONFIG_X86_TSC'ed 
macros in profile.h and pksched.h or replace them w/ inlines that wrap
the rdtsc calls w/ if(cpu_has_tsc && !tsc_disable) or some such line. 
But yea, its a start, assuming no one screams about not being able to
optimize out the timer_pit code.
thanks
