How about renumbering the nodes? Node 0 is the one with no DMA memory and 
node 1 may be the one with the DMA? That would take care of things even 
without core modifications. We can start on node 0 (which hardware 1) and 
consume the required memory for boot there not impacting the node with the 
DMA memory.
