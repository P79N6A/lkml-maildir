I disagree. When we have a booting kernel, finding out the used drivers
is not so difficult: kernel give us already enough informations (modules
loaded, in drivers that use some resources,...).
The problem is: what will be the use of such minimalistic/optimal but
non-modular kernel?
If I add a new device (such a modem, a printer, new USB device...) or
if I use a new disk with an other FS, the users of an autoconfiguration
will be lost, but not the users of the vendors kernels.
Thus the real problem is: where will use such autoconfiguration? Why?
IMHO it can be used only by expert, to find what drivers is need for
such device (when hotplug cannot help you).
