Hello,
One of the changes between 2.5.52 and 2.5.53 broke parport autoprobing.
I have a 2.5.53 kernel with all of parport built into the kernel and on
the kernel's command line "parport=auto". If I remove that, the oops goes
away. Since I don't have a serial console I wrote down the most important
bits of the oops:
EIP is at dma_alloc_coherent +0x18/0x80
Trace:
parport_pc_probe_port +0x42b/0x720
vgacon_scroll +0x140/0x230
scrup +0x133/0x140
mod_timer +0x12a/0x180
alloc_inode +0x17f/0x1b0
__pci_conf1_read +0xc3/0x100
pci_conf1_read +0x4a/0x50
pci_bus_read_config_byte +0x81/0x90
register_sysctl_table +0x67/0x90
init +0x3a/0x160
init +0x0/0x160
kernel_thread_helper +0x5/0x18
Hope this helps anyone to sort this out. If more info is necessary,
let me know.
Regards,
-Udo.
