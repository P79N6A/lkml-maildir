Outside of happyville ivory towers you probably have no choice. Only the
BIOS knows stuff like the RAM timings, and some windows drivers just use
the BIOS, others rely on being shipped compiled for the right variant of
card they came with.
We keep the BIOS segment data so you can re-post the card on the 16bit
resume path. Probably there should be a flag for relevant frame buffer
drivers to set that says "don't re-Post but call me later"

Thats pretty close to "there isnt any"

X people have been trying to do this for multihead setups for years.
You'll get Matrox, you'll get 3DFX voodoo1/2, you might get early SiS.
Intel - dunno, but the rest - no chance.

Short, long and forever. I agree we want drivers to be able to say "Don't POST
I can hack this one", however we need to accept the real world that most
hardware wants posting and that in many cases its what the windows driver
does anyway.
