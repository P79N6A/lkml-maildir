The fact that it works on one board doesn't mean that it works on _every_
board.
This is, in fact, why I will _NOT_ accept anything but a simple auto-dma
disable for this problem for early 2.4.x. I hope that people will continue
to work on and debug this problem, but it's just been around for too long,
and it's obvious enough that it doesn't happen with all hardware that I
doubt there is any other reasonable solution that doesn't require some
_very_ extensive testing to verify.
I'd love to see people who see these problems and are willing to test out
patches to fix it. But in parallel with that, I definitely want the 2.2.x
"disable auto-DMA" thing for the big public. We can enable it later if
some patch does seem to fix it for good.
