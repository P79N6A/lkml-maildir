I have exchanged private email with Ian. The problem in this case was
that the first block on the tape was larger than 16 kB. In this case the
2.4 tape driver returns error ENOMEM (not the most informative error code
but this is what the other Unices return). (The 2.2 driver silently ignores
this error.) With larger byte count dd succeeds and so there is no problem
in the kernel.
