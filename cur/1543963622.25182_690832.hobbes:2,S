FWIW, that is how the ia64 mca_recovery code prevents pages with
uncorrectable errors from getting reused.

I tried incrementing the page count but it did not play well with the
migration code (mm/migrate.c).  The migration code is used to copy
the data off the bad page to a new good page.  It currently will
try to free the old page after migrating.  My attempts to modify
that behavior would result in either the migration code not migrating
or pages with non zero page counts on a free list.

unmap_and_move() calls move_to_lru() which calls lru_cache_add().
This code only deals with pages that can be isolated. (isolate_lru_page())
