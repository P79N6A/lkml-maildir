2.4.9-ac12 has new ppc code for CPU feature fixups.  The ftr_fixup code
only handles entries that are built into the kernel.  timex.h defines
get_cycles() using ftr_fixup and get_cycles() is used all over the
place, including in modules.  AFAICT we need to add modutils support
for ftr_fixup.
Don't write any code yet, Maciej W. Rozycki has some patches for a
similar problem in mips and his fix is nicely extensible.  I just need
confirmation that ftr_fixup needs modutils support.
