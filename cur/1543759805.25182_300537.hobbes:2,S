Right, that was what I was thinking might be possible.  But for now I've
just done the simple patch --- make sure we don't clear
jh->b_transaction when we're just refiling buffers from one list to
another.  That should have the desired effect here without dangerous
messing around with locks.
I'm having trouble testing it, though --- I seem to be getting livelocks
in O_DIRECT running 400 fsstress processes in parallel; ring any bells? 
I get it with today's bk tree without any ext3 changes too, so at least
it's not a regression.
