Looks like it was. ls' read was sequential, too, so it did not get any
advantage. If you can definitely show that streaming io
(say, cat hugefile >/dev/null) flushes _non_ sequentially read data
(pages with program/library code, data of e.g. your Mozilla, etc),
please submit a report to lkml. VM gurus said more than once
that they _want_ to fix things, but need to know how to reproduce.
