Subject: [patch 40/69] driver-core: dont free devt_attr till the device is released
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: Tejun Heo <htejun@gmail.com>
Currently, devt_attr for the "dev" file is freed immediately on device
removal, but if the "dev" sysfs file is open when a device is removed,
sysfs will access its attribute structure for further access including
close resulting in jumping to garbled address.  Fix it by postponing
freeing devt_attr to device release time.
Note that devt_attr for class_device is already freed on release.
This bug is reported by Chris Rankin as bugzilla bug#8198.

Applies well to 2.6.20 and 21.  As sysfs-immediate-disconnect doesn't
seem to be included in 2.6.22, this should be included in linus#master
too (applies well there as well).
