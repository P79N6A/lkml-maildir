The CRC errors are indicative of cable or similar problems but each time
you see a CRC error the transmission is repeated so it should never cause
corruption. If there are repeated CRC errors it will give up and use PIO
instead.

Could be one driver is upsetting another, or perhaps triggering more
hardware which in turn triggers this. You'd really need to know what the
extra driver which triggers the problem is ?
