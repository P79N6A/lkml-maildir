Looking 256 at least makes sense to hold a dns fully qualified domain
name.  So even if it isn't specified by posix is make sense.
Can we please make the structure we return to user space look something
like:
struct long_utsname {
	char *sysname;
	char *nodename;
	char *release;
	char *version;
	char *machine;
        char *domainname;
        char buf[0];
}
int sys_long_uname(char *buf, size_t bufsz);
So we don't hard code the maximum length of these strings into the user
interface, and can just return more by increasing our buffer size.
