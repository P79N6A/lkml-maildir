direct-io.c is evil.  Ridiculously.

Great, I'd love to see the comparisons.

Well, there are always the 2.4 patches which are properly state drive and 
reasonably simple.  Retry was born out of a need to come up with a mechanism 
that had less impact on the core kernel code, and yes, it seems to be a 
failure and in dire need of replacement.
One other implementation to consider is actually using kernel threads 
compared to how syslets perform.  Direct IO for one always blocks, so 
there shouldn't be much of a performance difference compared to syslets, 
with the bonus that no arch specific code is needed.
