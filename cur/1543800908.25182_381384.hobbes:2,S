Well in theory yes, if you really expect thousand of tasks running...
But for most machines, number of concurrent tasks is < 200, and using a 
special cache for this is not a win.

As it is a refinement on a previous patch (that was integrated in 2.6.15) that 
put spin_lock after the array[] (so cleary using a separate cache line), I 
omited to describe it.
Yes, this part is really important because some multi-threaded benchmarks get 
a nice speedup with this separation in two parts.
Threads that are doing read()/write() (reading the first part of files_struct) 
are not slowed by others that do open()/close() syscalls (writing the second 
part), no false sharing (and no locking thanks to RCU of course).
Big Apache 2.0 servers, database servers directly benefit from this.
Note that process that tend to create/destroy a lot of threads per second are 
writing into 'count' field and might dirty the 'read mostly' part, but we can 
expect that well writen high performance programs wont do this.
