I sincerely dont know... Although:
- * NOTE: CONFIG_PARAVIRT is experimental and the paravirt_ops
- * semantics are subject to change. Hence we only do this
- * internal-only export of this, until it gets sorted out and
- * all lowlevel CPU ops used by modules are separately exported.
Makes me think there was a "good enough" reason to export instead of export GPL and that it "could" be usefull to keep the same behaviour for that same experimental feature under 2.6.20 / 2.6.21.  Although, the "until it gets sorted out" makes me think it might planned to get removed before the end of 2.6.22 
Thnx.
