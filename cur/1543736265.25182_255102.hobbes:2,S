pfmon comes from HP's perfmon package.  dplace is an SGI specific that is
being open sourced.  It allows very complex process placement within a
cpuset.  It uses process aggregates to migrate processes based upon stuff
like number of invocations of this name goes to this relative cpu.
Paul, aren't we going to adjust dplace so it uses the user libraries to
interpret the relative placement information provided in the application's
configuration file into kernel logical cpus before passing that into the
kernel module?
