It depends a bit on who you want to give control over what can and what
can't be loaded whether centralization is an advantage or not. It might
be a bit easier and simpler for the vendor, but if users have control
over their hardware and thus the keys, it doesn't make any difference.
Even for the vendor it isn't very hard to keep a database with all keys
and signing modules with the right key when needed.
I don't see where the lower cost or the increased toughness comes from.
Don't forget that you need to protect the stored public key against
modification as well (As well as the boot loader).

What about bytecode programs, self modifying software and mmap?
One exploitable bug in any program renders all this checking void.
But even then you can move all the checking to a userspace helper program.
(Which can be in initramfs, glued to the kernel binary.)

Time was never the problem, the extra code bloat and complexity is.
(Though if you're going to check all binaries it probably is.)
