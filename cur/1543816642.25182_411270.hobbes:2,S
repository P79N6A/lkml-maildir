@Mike: Do we have a testcase for the sleep problem?
@Con: Is it possible to patch staircase to address this issue as Mike
did with the stock kernel, so I can see the testcase suceeding?
Perhaps changing a little the interactivity detection algorithm
(disabling fairness a little)?
I would like to test any patches to improve this situation on staircase too.
I would like to see more cooperation on both of you, as you are trying
to solve the same problems as I can see.
Please keep walking in the same direction and try to help each other. :)
Thank you both for your effort, it is very apreciated,
