Serge,
I have just imported your series into the GIT repository where I have
been collating the various recent related submissions at:
  git://vserver.utsl.gen.nz/vserver
A summary of the submissions imported to date are at:
  
http://www.utsl.gen.nz/gitweb/?p=vserver;a=heads
I will endeavour to continue to collect and catalogue all vserver
related submissions I receive, see on LKML, or get pull requests for, as
a part of my efforts to merge this functionality.
Sam.
