Sometimes, there are better ways than implementing your
own stack.  For example, not having any kind of stack.
That means memory usage don't increase with the number of
chained symlinks.

Yes, but what if we don't need the ability to go back?
Consider this approach to symlinks:
1. We have a path component to resolve
2. It turns out to be a symlink.  So look it up, then
    loop back to (1)
This goes on until what we find isn't a symlink, or till some
overflow counter decides that we probably have a symlink loop.
With no memory of where we came from, there is no
recursive use of memory.  And no way of going back in
single steps, but I assume that isn't necessary here.
I could be wrong about that though.
