Hi,
Every kernel in the 2.6 serious so far has exhibited the same problem; after 
some time of running my desktop system, I get:
Assuming someone else called the IRQ
Spamming to the kernel log. Any idea what's causing this or how I can work out 
which driver has the bug? (I suspect yenta_socket, it didn't happen prior to 
me buying a PCI -> PCMCIA cardbus adaptor).

Although I have an nvidia video card in the system, the module was not loaded 
and X was not started, so I find it unlikely that this could be to blame. The 
video card would share IRQ 19 as well, if the driver was loaded.

Any suggestions would be very helpful.
