Hi,
  I'm interested in one specific "bug" reported out of these 120 and
no one seems to have responded about it yet. It reports the error on
line 889 (drivers/scsi/sd.c), but line 825 also seems bad (memsetting
the pointer that was allocated before checking for NULL). This piece
of code seems to go back to the 1.0 version of the kernel, hence my
suspcision about it actually being a bug. Anyone have thoughts about
it? Thanks!
