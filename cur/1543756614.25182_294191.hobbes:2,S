Hi,
Over the last few weeks I've collected a few patches in my tree
coming from others and it's time to merge them upstream:
	1/5: sonypi: replace schedule_timeout() with msleep()
	2/5: sonypi: add another HELP button event
	3/5: sonypi: use MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR in miscdevice.minor assignment.
	4/5: sonypi: fold the contents of sonypi.h into sonypi.c
	5/5: sonypi: add fan and temperature status/control
Please apply.
Thanks.
Stelian.
