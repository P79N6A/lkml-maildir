I'm not saying "let's use nsproxy" - I'm not yet convinced that the
lifetime/mutation/correlation rate of a pointer in an nsproxy is
likely to be the same as for a container subsystem; if not, then
reusing nsproxy could actually increase space overheads (since you'd
end up with more, larger nsproxy objects, compared to smaller numbers
of smaller nsproxy objects and smaller numbers of smaller
container_group objects), even though it saved (just) one pointer per
task_struct.
Reusing nsproxy versus using a separate container_group object as the
aggregator is mostly an implementation detail, i think, and it would
be pretty easy to switch from one to the other without any
user-visible changes. So I'm inclined to keep them separate at this
point.
