Right, nice personal attack to deflect the arguments I actually wrote.  If 
you aren't going to answer the arguments, then why do you even bother to 
reply?  If you are falling behind due to the load of incoming mail then it 
seems bass-ackwards to make non-sense replies and arguments that are 
unnecessary instead of actually responding to the real arguments made.
BTW, I've never used BK.  I've never actually even gone to the BK web 
site.  That's probably why I haven't bothered to read the submitting 
patches using BK *HOWTO* doc in the kernel doc area.

Wow, more personal attack whilst cutting the actual arguments out.  That's 
always a good way to win an argument.  <imagine the sarcastic tone of 
voice>  Of course, that's why I repeated the two points, one of which you 
again cut.

Yeah.  I'll go to bitkeeper.com to learn about how to use bitkeeper.  I 
don't expect nor want to go there to learn about how to send a patch to 
Linus.  It's not the appropriate venue for that information.

Hmmm....Daniel stopped his reply before he even got to the really
important arguments in my email.  Guess that just means I win those points
by default which should pretty much settle this entire issue.  All BK 
advocacy docs need to be transferred to bitkeeper.com.  All valid HOWTO 
docs relating to kernel patch submission (whether via diff+email or via 
BK) should report to the kernel doc directory where they belong.
