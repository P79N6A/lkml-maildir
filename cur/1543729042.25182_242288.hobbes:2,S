OK, I tried the quick hack of just returning 0 before taking the
spinlock in extract_entropy, but this broke /dev/random which prevented
me from logging in.  I guess we will have to properly fake it here.
Alas, it looks like the software RNG is not disabled when
CONFIG_HW_RANDOM is set.  I would call this a bug - imagine incurring
the overhead of software 3D acceleration even with hardware 3D
acceleration enabled.
