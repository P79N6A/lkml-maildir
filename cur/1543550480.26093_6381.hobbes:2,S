At the request of The Editors of Linux Today, I post the following
correction to the NTFS posting earlier today.
"....The excerts story from the Provo Daily Herald about Microsoft/TRG
were provided to the affected Linux folks on LKML with permission of the
reviewing editor of the story from the Provo Daily Herald.  Other than
to inform the Linux folks, no other commercial distribution rghts were
conveyed, and any news agencies wanting to reprint the story must obtain
permission from the Provo Daily Herald."
