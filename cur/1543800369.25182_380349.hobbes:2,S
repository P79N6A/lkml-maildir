The fact that it happens to be mozilla that crashes this time says
*nothing at all* as long as you have binary only modules loaded that
may have messed up the kernel without any way for us to debug that.

Agreed. As long as nvidia or vmware binary only modules have even been
loaded once, what state the kernel is in is a complete unknown.
To be useful, all testing you do *must* happen without both the nvidia
and vmware modules ever having been loaded. As soon as you load one of
them for even a second any further testing becomes irrelevant.

Not really, since anything it leaves in the logs may have been caused
by the binary only module(s), but we have no way to find out, so the
info is next to useless as long as binary only modules are loaded - it
may be correct or it may be wrong, but we have no way to know.
