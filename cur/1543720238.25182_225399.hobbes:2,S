I've been witnessing almost exactly the same thing as you.  I assumed,
perhaps falsely, that my AOpen CDRW was failing.  I just recently
replaced it with a DVD-Rom drive and thus far have not seen these
errors.
hdd: status error: status=0x59 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest
Error }
hdd: status error: error=0x20LastFailedSense 0x02
hdd: drive not ready for command
hdd: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdd: status error: error=0x00
hdd: drive not ready for command
hdd: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdd: status error: error=0x00
hdd: drive not ready for command
hdd: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdd: status error: error=0x00
hdd: DMA disabled
hdd: drive not ready for command
hdd: ATAPI reset complete
Could this be a kernel bug?  Please CC me as I'm no longer subscribed to
this list.
Thanks,
Steve
