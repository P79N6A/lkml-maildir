I think the idea is that if mdadm (for example) kicks out a faulty disk
from an array, it could also activate a LED (usually a different LED than
the "disk activity" LED) on the corresponding enclosure so that the admin
knows when standing in front of the storage server which disk to pull out
and replace.
