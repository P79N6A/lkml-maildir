First of all, the above code is to just illustrate a point. And as a matter of
fact it may not even work if some other kernel thread prints something while
do_foo() is executing, the whole thing will get screwed up.
If I remember correctly, I the second line of the "sample" code, will _NOT_
produce a timestamp. So, the output will be:
[1234567.123456] fooo.....<7>done.
where, the timestamp is that of the first printk.

I wouldn't go that far. I'd just let the kernel janitors people have fun with
the existing code :)
