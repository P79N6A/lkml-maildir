When aborting a "make -j bzlilo" using ctrl-c I got these errors with pre-7:
Jan 16 02:50:24 voyager kernel: swap_duplicate at   753100: entry 00753100,
unused page
Jan 16 02:50:24 voyager kernel: swap_duplicate at   870200: entry 00870200,
unused page
This is the first and only time I've seen this with this kernel.
