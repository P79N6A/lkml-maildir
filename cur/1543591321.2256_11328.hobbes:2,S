What about using atomic operations for that? This is more general
and works on ALL architectures. CMPXCHG is just and special
atomic operation on ia32.

   Documentation/DocBook/kernel-hacking.tmpl
But better do
   make htmldocs 
in the kernel top level directory and read
   Documentation/DocBook/kernel-hacking/lk-hacking-guide.html
instead.
Sample code is scattered all around in the kernel.
