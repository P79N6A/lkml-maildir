I think you're making an assumption about the vendor's support statement
that may not be valid. If I were a distro I wouldn't appreciate modutils
makeing statements about my support policies and confusing the newbies,
who are after all the target audience here. I'd take that last "or your
Linux vendor." bit off of this.
Note that this wouldn't be an issue if no one shipped modules that taint
the kernel, however, I've seen modules on cds for two of the major distros
that would taint the kernel lately. (drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c was just
recenly corrected for example.) Of course if *no one* shipped modules that
taint the kernel then this whole thing wouldn't be an issue. :)
