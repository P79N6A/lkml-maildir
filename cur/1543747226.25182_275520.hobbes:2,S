I had an idea for a filesystem as an alternative to using a raw disk
partition for storing a single (large) data file (eg. a DVD image or a
database data file), adding the convenience of a file length, permissions
and a uid/gid.
As I now have some functional code (a 'compile outside the kernel'
module, only tested against i386/2.6.9) I thought I'd share the sffs
(single file file-system) code for comments/testing.
Performance for a single file is between 0 and 40% faster than ext2,
(though sffs is not a general purpose filesystem).
Some more details/benchmarks:
