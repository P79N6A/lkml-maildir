: No, I'm not so sure. It's almost surely winmodem but there 
: are exist small chance that it's not a winmodem...
: 
: Why [almost] all PCI modems are winmodems? Well... PCI has 
: VERY complex protocol... so you'll need custom-made chip to
: handle it... and thus you need HUGE number of selled modems
: to be profitable... and since for most users winmodem is
: enough and it's cheaper then real modem better to create
: winmodem and not real one... so almost all PCI modems are 
: winmodems (even if it's not stated explicitly) but I hear
: rumours that there are exists real PCI modems and if you are
: lucky may be yours is not winmodem ... Chance is small
: hovever...
While I usually agree with you, 3Com/USR does have their
standard v90 NON-Windmodems available in the PCI variety.
I have a few in my stock room right now.
