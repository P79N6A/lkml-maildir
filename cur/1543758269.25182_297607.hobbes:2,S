Subject: cyrix_arr_init and centaur_mcr_init unused?

arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/cyrix.c has a routine cyrix_arr_init(), and
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/centaur.c has a routine centaur_mcr_init().
At first sight it looks like these are unused.
Do I overlook something?
(They occur as the .init fields of some struct, and I did not find any
calls of ->init().)
If there are no calls and the code is needed, then some systems
may be broken today. If the code is not needed, maybe it should
be removed.
