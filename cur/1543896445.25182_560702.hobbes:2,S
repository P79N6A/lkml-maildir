Of course, although perhaps it could.  More likely my thought was that
the service when it decides to download an update, would include the
updated bios image and put it on the boot drive where the existing bios
can find it.  No signature needs to be added to the boot drive or
kernel, just checksums in the bios image.

Perhaps they should just explicitly say that then.
