(Who's this 'we' kemosabe? I do. Desktop systems are increasingly using
databases for their day-to-day tasks. As they should, a db is not
something that should be reinvented poorly.)

Hmm, let's try this again. Anything that communicates out of process
as part of its normal usage for Getting Work Done gets impacted by the
scheduler. That means pipelines in the shell, d-bus on the desktop, and
lots of other things that follow the unix philosophy of lots of little
programs communicating.

They really aren't, unless you happen to work somewhere that can afford
to dedicate a box to a db, which suddenly makes the scheduler a dull
topic.
For example, I have a db and web server installed on my laptop, so
that the few times that I have to do web app programming (while wearing
a mustache and glasses so that I don't have to admit to it in polite
company), I can be functional with just one computer.

We have one already, it's called write(). We have another called
read(), too. Okay, so they have some data related side-effects other
than the scheduler hints, but I claim the scheduler hint is already
implicitly there.

Do you have data, or at least a theory to back up that hypothesis?

Really not. I'm trying to get across that this is a general problem
with interprocess communication, or any systems that rely on multiple
processes to make forward progress on a problem. Sure, let the clients
make forward progress until they can't any more. If they stop making
forward progress by blocking on a read or sleeping after a write to
another process, then there's a big hint there as to who should get
focus next.

They'd have it automatically, if they were spending their time computing
rather than rendering.
