It looks like discussion is focused on a problem how to detect a removed
card. While this problem definitely exists - I'd like to stress that the
original report was about a normal shutdown case. Just do init 0 with
card plugged in and system hangs. IMHO that should be dealt with in the
first place.
As for general case, I do not know hardware well enough. If as mentioned
some architectures have a general problem accessing removed devices then
CardBus driver should not call normal cleanup sequence in this case and
just signal abort condition to a low level driver (so that any in-memory
structures may be removed without an attempt to actually touch
hardware).
