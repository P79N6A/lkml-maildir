Hi to all!
I'm user of ALTLinux Sisyphus. I have kernel 2.4.22 installed on. And I have
PCMCIA Network Card installed on Acer TravelMate 723TXV. My friend gave me USB
Flash Disk (PQI Travelling Disk, 32Mb).
When I try to plug it, my system halts. Ok, then I unplug my PCMCIA NetCard and
reboots. Then I retry to plug it. And... my system don't see this FlashDisk! I
looking at "dmesg | more":
---------------------------------------------------------------------
hub.c: new USB device 00:04.2-1, assigned address 2
usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=2 (error -110)
hub.c: new USB device 00:04.2-1, assigned address 3
usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=3 (error -110)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
After I booting my system a new I see at "dmesg | more" again:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
usb.c: registered new driver usbdevfs
usb.c: registered new driver hub

I tryed to search info about this problem - there are many letter with this question
but no more answers in the Web. I find only one letter from <manfred@colorfullife.com>

That's interesting. It's obivously a bios bug:
The USB controller only supports interrupt 9 (mask==0x200 -->bit 9), is
right now running on irq 9 according to the bios data.
But according to the piix irq router, it's connected to irq 10.
First we must figure out where the bios lies. Could you try the attached
patches?
The patches are alternatives, first try option 1, then option 2.

I tryed to use patch No 2 with kernel-2.4.21 and it really works: no conflicts, all works and Linux
work with Travelling Disk on my Acer TravelMate. But why this patch is not applied to kernel?
I think, this is not only my problem, but some peoples too.
