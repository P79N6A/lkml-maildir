and then read/write will return -EINVAL which is life-threatening.
O_DIRECT like rawio via /dev/raw imposes special buffer size and
alignment (size multiple of softblocksize of the fs and softblocksize
alignment, at max I can turn it down to hardblocksize without intensive
changes and guaranteeing zerocopy [modulo bounce buffers on x86 of
course]).
So in short at least glibc would need to be replaced...
