i was wondering now for about few months about gcc/egcs optimisation
flags. i was looking at documentation (in /usr/doc/egcs, etc.) but found
nothing about switches you mentioned. is there any documentation about
such switches (and possibly some more info about optimisation itself -
i.e. risk and advantages of optimising for particular CPU, ...) on the
net?
