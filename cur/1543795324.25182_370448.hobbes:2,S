Something strange here.   After a cg-update, I had no tag for rc2.   Checking
showed no problems so I used cg-clone to get another copy of the repository.
Still no rc2.
ed@grover:/usr/src/2.6$ cg-version
cogito-0.16rc2 (73874dddeec2d0a8e5cd343eec762d98314def63)
ed@grover:/usr/src/2.6$ git --version
git version 0.99.9.GIT
cg-clone 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
 2.6
It looks to be the tag that is missing, gitk show commits after Nov 19.
Both git and cg were  updated just prior to the cg-update (~Nov 22 8pm EST).
What is happening?
TIA
Ed Tomlinson
