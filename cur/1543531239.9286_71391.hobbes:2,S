some callers of sleep_on() do that to reduce the race:
        spin_unlock(&io_request_lock);
<<<<<< wake-up could arrive.
        sleep_on(&wait_queue);
        spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);
Actually I would prefer if we could add a big assert to sleep_on() in
2.5.early:
sleep_on is a very simple function with a nice name, and thus many drivers
use it without proper locking [global_cli or lock_kernel].
