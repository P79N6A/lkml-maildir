Sorry, but from the moment I got this machine (2.3.20 or so) 2.3.x gave
severe filesystem corruption on it. I tried several 2.3.x on and off, the
first one I tried that was stable enough for any use was 2.3.42aa2. It has
the same problem. I don't remember for sure if I tried 2.3.x before with
CDs (I had other worries :).
2.2.15pre6 and 2.3.42aa3 gave:
kernel: hdd: ide_wait_noerr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error } 
kernel: hdd: ide_wait_noerr: error=0xb4 
kernel: hdd: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error } 
kernel: hdd: set_drive_speed_status: error=0xb4 
kernel: hdd: ATAPI 40X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache, DMA 
kernel: Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.06 
(Revision 2.56 doesn't give any of this nonsense)
It is identified as CRD-8400C, ATAPI CDROM drive, alone on ide1.

Any easy way to create a tiny isofs filesystem?
