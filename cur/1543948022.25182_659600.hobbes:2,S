Aha, so you do not have s2ram from suspend.sf.net installed, do you?
Restoring the screen is done by either
a) kernel/bios (acpi_sleep=..., or better s2ram -f -a X )
b) vbetool
c) X
. s2ram should detect your machine, and automatically set acpi_sleep
and/or perform vbetool magic.
Please try s2ram, there's good chance it will just work.
