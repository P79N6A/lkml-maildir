No it will not. Please reread Dominik's mail I linked to. It explains 
it clearly.

I think the misunderstanding on your side is relative to what there
is less heat. Throttling essentially reduces temporary heat spikes on
the silicon, but does not make the system overall take less power
or generate less heat as measured over a longer time because it will
be idle less.
