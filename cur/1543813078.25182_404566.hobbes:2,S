I have a multimedia keyboard with some keys not mapped in linux, which
i intend to create mappings for. When i connect it to serio0, those
unknown keys trigger messages on the console about it, but when its
conncted to a usb port, nothing gets printed, and Ive even set console
loglevel to 8. What am i missing?
