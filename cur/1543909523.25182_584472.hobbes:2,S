Hi Jakub,
actually, it is currently arch-specific, and that's because of different 
memory layouts on different archs.
It turned out recently that PIE-compiled binaries on x86_64, that perform 
larger amount of brk-allocations (for example bash) will not work (but 
they will work on ?86). This is because currently on ?86 the memory layout 
is as follows:
[TEXT][HEAP]...[MMAP area]..[STACK]..[VDSO]
for PIE-complied binaries, the situation is as follows (with the patch):
[MMAP area]...[TEXT][HEAP]..[STACK]..[VDSO]
which is perfectly fine (except for the non-randomized brk). However, on 
x86_64, the memory layout is different:
[TEXT][HEAP][MMAP area]..[STACK]..[VDSO]
which directly shows why brk() doesn't work well here -- it very soon hits 
another mmaped VMA.
I am currently thinking about the best way to address this issue -- I am 
thinking about randomizing brk properly (which we want to do anyway), so 
that it is placed in the area that doesn't overlap with mmap range.

Yes, I agree -- when we sort out the memory layout problems.
