... against the current top-of-bkcvs 2.6 kernel.
This version of the patch makes *both* legacy and Unix98 ptys configure 
options (Unix98 only if EMBEDDED), and the number of legacy ptys is a 
configuration option -- useful if you want to reduce the memory 
footprint, or if you really wants lots of these guys (256 is no longer a 
hard limit.)
Additionally, I have added a sysctl option -- /proc/sys/kernel/pty/max 
-- for limiting the number of Unix98 ptys.  It was way too effective a 
DoS to eat up all kernel memory by opening /dev/ptmx repeatedly.  The 
default is 4096, but it can be adjusted all the way up to 2^20 if desirable.
