All these points are very similar to the actual implementation in AUFS,
except 'Optimization 2: decide memory size by stat().'
- the size may not be enough for storing every dirent, it depends upon
  the filesystem's implementation.
- the size may be a block size which can be larger than page size even
  if it is a empty dir, also it depends upon the filesystem.
