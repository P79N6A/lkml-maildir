This is _wrong_. The timer doesn't even know whether something is an idle
task or not.
Proof: kapmd (right now the scheduler doesn't know this either, but at
least we could teach it to know).
Don't try to make the timer code know stuff that the timer code should not
and does not know about. Just call the scheduler on each tick, and let the
scheduler make its decision.
