	Well, AIX 4.3 (and 4.[12] I think as well) uses 16:16, and they
are preparing for 32:32 when the kernel finaly goes fully 64-bit.  I
don't know enough about AIX 5.1 to know if they really did that or
backed down on their promise (The kernel guys told me two years ago that
they were going to push the full 64-bit migration, but I haven't heard
anything since).
