Alan, never attribute to conspiracy that which is adequately explained by 
stupidity.  You would be surprised how often newspaper and magazine 
reporters and their editors make gaffs like this with absolutely no intent 
of malice, or with the sole malice of wanting to write an article that will 
be "interesting" to a large readership while taking insufficient time to 
check all the facts.
When I worked at a magazine as a staffer, I was amazed when the 
editor-in-chief, in response to complaints about a columnist who "got it 
wrong" a lot, said that he kept the columnist on because his mistakes 
attracted readership.  "He gets TONS of letters, and the readers can't wait 
to see how he screws up next!"  Again, not by intent, but by incompetence.
For reporters, it's not a matter of "not caring," it's a matter of being 
required to knock out 15 articles in one day (not uncommon for a reporter 
on a major metropolitan newspaper) and not having to hand references that 
are willing to provide answers quickly.
Final comment:  Know what a well-adjusted paranoid is?  "Hey, they ARE out 
to get you, but it's nothing personal."
