Thanks for raising that issue. It is my understanding that PIO ops are
synchronous (on IA-32). If that is correct, problems should only occur if
the driver is built with MMIO support, no?
I have been building the driver without MMIO for quite a while to eliminate
one source of problems for now.

You won't see me rule out driver bugs as a likely explanation for anything
anytime soon ;-).

ACK.
