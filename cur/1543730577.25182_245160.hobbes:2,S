I agreee, reverse engineering machine code is not trivial, especially
with the tools currently available. However I don't think that the
difficulty is intrinsic. It is possible (though obviously not simple) to
wite software that is able to infer a great deal from machine code
automatically and produce pretty good decompilations.
Also I think that the pciproxy[0] technique currently offers a simpler
solution. Analyzing the data produced is more akin to reverse
engineering a network protocol than machine code. Reverse engineering
protocols is much less 'copyright sensitive' than decompiling machine
code and, I think, more easily shared.
Anyway, perhaps once I've had some time to make a little more progress
we would be able to compare some notes?
[0]. I should probably explain the technique. It basically involves
running supported operating systems under a PC emulator, and trapping
and logging i/o on the PCI bus.
