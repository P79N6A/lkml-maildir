some other unixes (e.g. SCO) to use the character floppy device for
making multivolume tar archives.  If you read the archive under Linux's
block device (and even using the multivolume flag to tar) it reads the
first diskette and stops.  This can be a real show stopper when you are
trying to install foreign software to run under iBCS2, e.g.
