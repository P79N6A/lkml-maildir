This is interesting.  This is a result of the menuconfig changes,
which made NET_PCMCIA a boolean, and then some tristates depend
on NET_PCMCIA and the boolean -> tristate dependencies aren't
specific enough.
Your fix is one way to do it.  I'd prefer to make
NET_PCMCIA a tristate instead, then let its value trickle down
to the subordinate config symbols.
This probably means that some of the other menuconfig changes
need to be audited for this "feature."
Here is my preferred patch.

Make NET_PCMCIA a tristate symbol so that net/pcmcia drivers
are constrained to M when needed.
