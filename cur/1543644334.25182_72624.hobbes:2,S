I will try something more recent, but I don't think this will happen
soon again. The UML that had the problems is running a mailserver with
amavis and spamd, it has an uptime of about 28 days. The other UMLs on
the same host are running for 73 days now, without any problems. 
I had problems with to many processes inside the UML before, but not
like this. Processes in the UML timed out (exim pipe delivery) and new
ones could not be started, but I cannot see the reason.
