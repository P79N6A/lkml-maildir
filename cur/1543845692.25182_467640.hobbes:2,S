mainline as of today + several unrelated Calgary patches I'll post
shortly + your PCI domains patch + my Calgary patch. I'll test with
iommu=off next.

Not necessarily - Calgary is an isolating IOMMU, meaning that if we
set up a mapping for aic94xx in the wrong IO space due to a Calgary
bug, aic94xx will fall over and die. Usually however this happens a
lot sooner. Also, we have code in Calgary to detect when an errant DMA
happens and it hasn't triggered in this case.
