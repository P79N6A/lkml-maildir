In particular, anyone who was having trouble with sched-domains and/or CPU
hotplug please test this.
It is supposed to fix all known issues, but some patches are fairly involved,
and not having been tested on problem hardware, there could be still some bugs.
Please let me know if anything goes bug.
Also, ia64 sched-domains setup is possibly still broken. If anyone boots this
on an Altix, please send over the full dmesg! Thanks.
