OTOH people often just send patches directly to you without bothering to 
contact the maintainer. There is no system that sends out notifications, 
if a patch touches file x/y, so that one has a chance to comment on them.
To be very clear on this, I don't want to control what goes in, I'd just 
like to know about changes _before_ they go in.

One should also add that bk is not the answer to everything, e.g. bk 
doesn't really help with maintaining separate patches. As one cannot 
remove or change information from/in bk, that makes it difficult to 
work on a series of patches, e.g. as Andrew does with -mm, a tool like 
quilt is more helpful here.
This means patches should only be put into bk, when they are ready 
(otherwise the repo accumulates useless info nobody is really interested 
in), during their development bk is about as useful as any other SCM 
system. bk simplifies mainly your work, but the further one is away from 
the core of this developer network, the more bk looses its advantage 
(and might only increase the amount of merge information bk has to 
manage in relation to patch information).
bye, Roman
