You're right, it's so much better to manage all machines independently
so that they can get out of sync with each other.
Did you even consider that this is virtually identical to the problem
that a network of workstations or servers has?  Did it occur to you that
people have solved this problem in many different ways?  Or did you just
want to piss into the wind and enjoy the spray?

Yeah, that's what I want, my password file management in the kernel.  
Brilliant.  Why didn't I think of that?

Whoops, you are so right, in order to work on OS scaling I'd better solve
password file management or the OS ideas are meaningless.  Uh huh.  I'll
get right on that, thanks for setting me straight here.
