True. The current ondemand behaviour is by design. When CPU 
is at the lowest freq, and there is a sudden surge in load, 
we want it to go to max freq immediately, rather than wait 
for some more polling intervals. If max freq is too high, 
it will naturally lower to some intermediate freq later. 
We can never accurately predict freq for some future load. 
Say a CPU capable of 600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400 KHz, is 
running at 600 and we have sudden 100% CPU utilization, then 
we cannot precisely say which should be the next freq. It 
can be any of the higher possible freqs. And we felt performance 
should get a higher priority whenever there is some 
tradeoffs like this.
