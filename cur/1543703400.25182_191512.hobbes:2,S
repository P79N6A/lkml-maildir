another thing as im still playing with this
the swapfiles size is 143656 kb
/proc/swap reports 127476 kb
thats makes a difference of 16180 kb, so 4 kb must be missing since a 
swapfile is 16184
these are exactly the 4 bytes in the /swap/linux8.swp
i just tried to less it - the process went right into D state :p
