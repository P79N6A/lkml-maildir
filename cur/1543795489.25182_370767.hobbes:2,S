Yes, both the old and new read-ahead logic issue read-ahead requests before
the pages are immediately needed. It is called look-ahead in the new logic,
which achieves I/O pipelining, and helps hide the I/O latency.

Thanks, I have read about the paper, quite informative :)
It's just that some one suggested about the feature, and it's just a matter of
lifting some limit values in the code - so I did it :)
