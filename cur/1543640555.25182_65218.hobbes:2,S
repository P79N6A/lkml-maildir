Right.
This test from ret_from_intr could be used instead:
push %es
push %ds
push %eax
movl 8(%esp), %eax
movb 4(%esp), %al
testl $(VM_MASK | 3), %eax
jz handle_kernel_mode
There is however a potential register stall for the eax read after the
al write.
BTW, vm86 has the VM flag set so the comment in ret_from_intr is wrong.
The code seems to be right though.
