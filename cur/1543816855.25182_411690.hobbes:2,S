I don't insure that. But does it matter?!?
If the task is still blocked on a lock and the owner of that lock might
need boosting. The boosting operation itself will always be _correct_ as the
pi_lock is held when it is done. But the task doing the boosting might have
preempted for so long that there is nothing left to do - and then it
simply stops unless deadlock detection is on.
I think we talk about the situation
                        B locks 1            C locks 2       D locks 3
                        B locks 2, boosts C and block
      A locks 2
      A is boost B
      A drop it's spinlocks and is preempted
                                             C unlocks 2 and auto unboosts
                        B is running
                        B locks 3, boosts C and blocks
      A gets a CPU again
      A boosts B
      A boosts D
Is there anything wrong with that?
And in the case where A==D there indeed is a deadlock which will be
detected.
