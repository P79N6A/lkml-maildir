But, if the sender does not attempt to close the socket until the ACK 
returns, then the receiver will see an unfinished connection and 
(hopefully) realise that the message is unsafe and not attempt to 
send it.
With SMTP, the last piece of data is a QUIT anyway, which occurs 
after the end-of-message marker - once the QUIT is sent and/or 
received, both ends know that the connection is finished with and 
will close the socket independently of each other.  If the network 
disappears before the QUIT comes along, the receiver should be 
discarding messages and the sender retrying later.
