I'm well aware of how FUA works, hence the barrier FUA implementation
does flush and then write-fua. The win compared to flush-write-flush is
just a saved command, essentially.

The problem is flush not working, the block layer can't fix that for you
obviously. If it's FUA not working, the block layer should fall back to
flush-write-flush, as they are obviously functionally equivalent.
