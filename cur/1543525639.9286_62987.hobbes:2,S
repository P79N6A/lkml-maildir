My computer is stable [2.3.44, both HIGHMEM64G and normal].
* IDE
* 192 MB ram
* Dual PII/350.
I was running both X and I recompiled the complete kernel.
I had some problems with 2.3.43 that went away when I upgraded to 2.3.44
and recompiled everything. Could you double check that 2.3.43 was
stable? 2.3.43 included a major TLB flush change, perhaps a TLB problem
with a hardware driver?
