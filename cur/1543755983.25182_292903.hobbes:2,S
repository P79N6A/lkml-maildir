Well, either you call userspace synchronously or you crash on resume.
I know what I prefer. And this synchronous call isn't so bad because
it comes with a timeout. So whatever the userspace program does, after
two seconds the kernel will continue unaffected. Once you execute the code
asynchronously, you get nondeterministic behaviour. That's sure fun for
filling up your random pool, but I wouldn't trust my data to such a system.
