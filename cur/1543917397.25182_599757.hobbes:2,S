After the first trouble with -rc4-mm1 I switched back to -rc3-mm1. I
booted that kernel 7 times over 4 days and never had trouble. (Before
-rc4-mm1 came out, I used -rc3-mm1 for over a week)
So in case of -rc3-mm1 I'm pretty sure that it works.
Not completely sure is if 2.6.23-rc7-sglist kernel works. I booted
that 9 times, but from a quick look in /var/log/messages, I might not
have hit the "correct" situation to trigger the error.
That kernel is vanilla 2.6.23-rc7 plus the patch from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/tomo/misc/v2.6.23-rc7-sglist-arch.diff.bz2
