As I type this my DHCP server is saying
ov  5 20:58:12 dugite dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:c0:26:2d:be:12 via 
eth0

and the poor sod at the other end is
setting half-duplex ....
sending DHCP and RARP requests .... Timed out!
IPConfig: Retrying forever (NFS root).
Here's how I'm booting:
root@numbat /root]# cat /misc/fd1/syslinux.cfg
default linux
prompt 1
display boot.msg
timeout 100
label linux
        kernel vmlinuz
        append  root=/dev/hda5
[root@numbat /root]
I'm running dhcp-2.0pl5-4 on RHL 7.1.
If I override the boot prompt:
ip=bootp
then it works.
Now I can see that I misunderstood the documentation (which, btw, could 
use a minor touch-up to mention DHCP), but
but
According to the source code, ip=dchp is legit. However, it causes lots 
of messages on the server just like above., and the client's looping 
just like before.
Two things I'd like to see:
1) A message to the user if an invalid value's given
2) DHCP actually work. BOOTP seems fine, as far as BOOTP goes.
I have RARP genned, but there's not actually anything to talk to.
