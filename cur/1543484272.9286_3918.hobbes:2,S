There is more info here:

At this point, ACLs are awaiting Remy Card's completion. I believe there
are patches floating around..
Capabilities are currently missing VFS support (this was vetoed for 2.2)
I'm not aware that anyone has working code for the other POSIX 6 stuff.
Ted Ts'o holds the keys to the linux-privs@mit.edu email list that was
used to coordinate the capability code.
Hope that helps...
Cheers
Andrew
