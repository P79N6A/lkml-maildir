Look at the file "include/asm-<proc>/param.h to find the symbol "NGROUPS".
Change that to whatever value you like.
The "task_struct" is the per-process descriptor.  You can find it in
"/usr/src/linux/include/linux/sched.h", but you shouldn't need to change
anything there.
Once you've changed "NGROUPS", then "make clean oldconfig dep bzImage modules"
as usual.  That will change the kernel's idea how how many groups you can have. 
You will probably need to recompile the userland stuff, from LIBC to the shells
because "NGROUPS" can be pervasive.
Your mileage may vary.
