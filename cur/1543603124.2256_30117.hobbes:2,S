Well, i didn't notice any announcement of e.g. 2.4.11pre1 nor here or
on linux-kernel-announce :-(. Sometimes :inus didn't announce these pre
at all, or just append changelog to some other mail, which is rather
messy and one can't track it easily. Obviously one can wrote a simple
perl script which will periodically finger vger and notify you (i saw
once one on freshmeat), but this is imho more convient and better way,
and you can even figure what changed and if there's a need for upgrade.
Vivat Alan (also) from this point of view ;-).
