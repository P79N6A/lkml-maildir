We'd need:
a) way to tell acpi not to control fans any more
b) in kernel watchdog so that acpi starts controlling fans after oom
killer
c) way to control passive cooling from userspace.
Not something doable for 2.6.22.

It would happily occur under Windows. You just needed to load machine
in a way that cpu stayed ~80C.
