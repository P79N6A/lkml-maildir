This may not help a lot, since I use Slackware for most of my systems -
I would create the kernel on a different system that is already running
(IDE based desktop for instance). Then create a LILO boot floppy. This
should allow you to boot the new kernel, but mount the root partition from
the CD in the same manner as the initial CD boot does from the RedHat
distribution.
This gives you a boot kernel that could be copied to the root file system
for subsequent boots, and could be used for a recovery floppy.
After completing the installation (except for reboot) replace the kernel
on the root file system with the one from the boot floppy. Reinstall the
boot (lilo) and the system should be ready for the first disk based boot.
