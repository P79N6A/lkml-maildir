Hi!
pci driver's resume must not be called during RESUME_POWER_ON because
interrupts are still off and i8259A is not initialized [OHCI kills
machine in such case, cardbus probably too. PCI drivers just assume
initialized interrupts.]
Second hunk fixes device_resume calls to be okay according to
documentation. Please apply,
								Pavel
