Sure, I've uploaded the config to
http://codeprobe.de/tmp/config-2.6.24-4-generic
It only happens when changing the cpu_share for another user and this
user needs to have a cpu hogging process running (like boinc, a
while-1 loop or similar).
It does not dump anything to the console, but the VirtualBox process
on the host takes all CPU - there seems to be no crash, but an endless
loop only.
I have reported it at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9779
already, with a testcase (outlined above).
Thank you for your help.
