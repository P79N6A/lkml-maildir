Please, stop with the documentation thing.  ALSA is perfectly well
documented.  I guess the problem is that you googled "ALSA
documentation" and this page didn't come up as the first hit (or even on
the first page):
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/index.html
This is a Google bug.  I suspect that the copius inter-document links
that Doxygen creates causes Google to think someone is trying to spam it
and penalizes the result.
