I meant your quoted excerpt. I did not remember the correct spelling of
the option, remembered only something like "USB function for dos".
I thought also it must be some garbage left from BIOS or so, but when using
arrow keys to select another item, lilo puts something like
"2.6.0-test6-mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4mm4"...
onto the screen. One backspace erases whole 5 lines.
I flashed BIOS cause I thought ECS might have fixed it (if it is its
fault) from January version to august version, same error.
I was fed up now and installed grub, which works like a charme.
Well, completely nokernel issue and I should write a bug report to the
lilo folks...
Or is it a BIOS error still which grub copes around with?
Regards, Konsti
