Then he would prove himself to be a hypocrite *and* destroy everything the 
Free Software Foundation putatively stands for.  (And would probably get to 
hear mocking laughter from James Gosling, if only in his imagination.)  It 
could conceivably happen, but I wouldn't worry too much about it; it'd cost 
him more than it would us.  Linus can re-release the kernel under a 
different license, and I doubt there'd be much argument from the various 
contributors, were the GPL so subverted.
And no, I don't believe RMS would do so over a name.  I don't doubt that 
*something* could lead to it, if only because everyone has a breaking point, 
but I don't think this is his breaking point.
Not to mention --- consider a slight modification of the above:
"If Richard Stallman gets mad at the linux community for not using the 
Hurd...."
The GPL does not confer the right to be a despot on its author.
(BTW, the implied insult to RMS is not called for.)

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
