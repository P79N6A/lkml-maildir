Good idea.  Let's go back in time to 1994/5 and add d_type then.  May I
remember you that I always wanted large data types but whenever it was
proposed the kernel people (including you) said: we don't need it this
big now therefore it won't be changed.

You can't be serious.  Can you even imagine the pain this would cause?
