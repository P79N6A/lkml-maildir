As well as what others have pointed out, without NCQ the disk is forced 
to accept the data in the order that the host provides it. If the host 
writes a burst of data that doesn't fill the write cache it's not as 
much of an issue, but if the write cache fills up then the disk may have 
to flush out data in a suboptimal order since it can't see what other 
requests are coming and can't change the order in which that data shows up.
