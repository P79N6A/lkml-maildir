So you're busy.  So is averyone else here.. that buys you nothing.
So you're a distributor with a vested interest in a functional beta
kernel.. and have no time/resources to contribute to having it all
delivered to you on your schedule.  Now _that_ does buy you something.
You could _contribute_ by struggling with some of the small shit.
That can make the difference between guru doing serious as a heart
attack development work and guru fixing silly assed typos.  But then
again, it usually _is_ 'someone else's job' if there's no money or
glory to be had.

Neither am I.  I'm a volunteer crash-test dummy.

Essentially, it sounds to me like you're too busy trying to make a buck
to do anything except crack the whip.  That uses up your oxygen ticket
as far as I'm concerned.
