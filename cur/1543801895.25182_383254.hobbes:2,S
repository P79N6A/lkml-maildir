I dont think so. It is too much to read to an supporter by phone, and
somebody who can diag that self knows exactly where the root is searched in
his config. After all it can only be a hardware or driver problem.
I think it makes much more sense to allow scrollback than to delay
printouts. (And I am quite sure scrollback works in this case)
