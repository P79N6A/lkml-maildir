(forgot to CC: this to the list when i replied to Jens, and decided to add
another paragraph)
I just tried my Seagate drive, and i can read my tapes in it.  If i swap
over to the HP, i can't read the tapes.  I'll look today, whether the
Seagate replies with a bunch of those I/O Errors.  It's not like i'm doing
anything but working on making this damn tape drive work =)
Considering the HP 7/14 gig format is already a proprietory format(<sarcasm>
THANKS HP! </sarcasm>), it wouldn't surprise me if something else is non
standard.  It's weird that i can read 7/14 gig tapes in the 10/20 Seagate
though.  Nice of Seagate to include support for someone else's mistake =)
