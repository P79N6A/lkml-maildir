Having established that the oops was not the cause of the hangs I have
been observing with MCYRIXIII, could anyone suggest ways to track down
if this is a compiler or kernel bug?
I have just complied latest git (with tcp_input.c oops fix)
With CONFIG_MCYRIXIII I got a hang with empty logs and nothing on the
serial line, sysrq unresponsive after about 2 hours
CONFIG_M586MMX has been solid
