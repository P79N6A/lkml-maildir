Subject: [PATCH] printks in drivers/scsi/hosts.c missing return
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/12/11/13

Linus is away so I am just throwing this out on lkml...
Trivial but annoying: two printk() calls in drivers/scsi/hosts.c are
missing '\n'
Also, for some reason I have not yet investigated, shost_tp->name is
NULL here.  This should not be, eh?  If it can be, we should do
something to tidy up the printing of it.
Patch is against 2.5.51.
