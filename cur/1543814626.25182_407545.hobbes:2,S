Seconded.
An even nicer way (this solution seems somewhat asymmetric) than
   prio_array_t *target = rq->active;
   if (batch_task(p))
     target = rq->expired;
   enqueue_task(p, target);
may be
   prio_array_t *target;
   if (batch_task(p))
     target = rq->expired;
   else
     target = rq->active;
   enqueue_task(p, target);
and thus (but this coding style may be considered overloaded):
   prio_array_t *target;
   target = batch_task(p) ?
	rq->expired : rq->active;
   enqueue_task(p, target);
But this discussion is clearly growing out of control now ;)
