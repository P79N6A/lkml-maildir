According to
http://kernelnewbies.org/documents/kdoc/kernel-api/r1708.html
 I should
be able to use memchr in a module, however, when I try to load the
module insmod complains that memchr is not available; a grep memchr
/proc/ksyms shows that it doesn't exist.
Is there some special kernel option I have to set to enable it? memcpy
and other mem* externs are there.
Thank you (for answering a simple question)
