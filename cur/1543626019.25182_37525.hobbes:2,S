Hello,
I have found this advisory on BUGTRAQ about d_path() :
http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/264117
I have made the following modifications in the d_path() of
Linux 2.2.20 : d_path() return an empty string when the path is
too large.

I don't know, if it really fixes well the problem, but i tested the
proposed exploit on my patched kernel and getcwd() does return an error.
It is probable that you have already fixed this, in a better way.
