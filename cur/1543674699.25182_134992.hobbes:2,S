Hi,
Just compiled this kernel with 8139too as module. I have adsl (pppoe) 
connection. Problem is, connection is lost after about 2-5 minutes after 
start.
I tested eth card with 
ftp://ftp.scyld.com/pub/diag/rtl8139-diag.c
and found something like this "configured with ABNORMAL settings".Or 
something like this. So I downloaded driver (v1.01)from www.realtek.com.tw,
replaced 8139too module and now all semms to be ok.
This diag tool says now : "configured with normal settings"
