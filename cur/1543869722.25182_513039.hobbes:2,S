Do you guys have an option of using just one partiton, and
divide it into two fixed parts at mkfs-time , one part X% (for metadata)
and  2nd part at (100-X)% (file file  blocks) ? Would not this option
be easier-to-administer choice for naive users ? Or, you do not
view your FS as an option for naive users in the first place ?
