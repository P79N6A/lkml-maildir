Hello, world!\n
   Is there any reason for setting current->dumpable to 0 in sys_setuid()?
It seems to me it doesn't close any security problem (since you need to
be root to change UID and if it the program was setuid, core dumps
should have been already disabled at this point) and it makes debugging
of daemons switching their UID a lot harder.
				Have a nice fortnight
