I really like "fix it before we build on an unstable foundation".
It seems to me that we could get to something like tinderbox (? One of the
mozilla tools).  What I'm imagining is something like a web page which
has a set of links in which point at the csets which cause the problem.
In order to make this work, we need to fix BK/Web to talk URLs with
"keys" instead of revs because, as some of you have noticed, revs change
when there is parallel development which makes the URLs pretty useless
if they contain revs.
If you need that fix in order to be able to have a list of URLs pointing
int BK/Web on bkbits.net, bug me about it, we'll do it right away.
I like the idea of having a status page which says "these changesets
cause problems".  You can have two links, one which gets you to the BK
cset html and the other which gets the patch corresponding to the cset.
