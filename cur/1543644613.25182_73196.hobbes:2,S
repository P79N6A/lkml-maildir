I've got per user scheduling.  I'm currently porting it to 2.4.19
(and having fun with some very subtle bugs) and am thinking about
how to port this beast to the O(1) scheduler in a clean way.
Note that it's not necessarily per user, it's trivial to adapt
the code to use any other resource container instead.
