  Until you can submit a grievance with a kernel compiled with egcs
and have people listen to you, stick with gcc-2.7.2.3.  (:
  linux-2.1 & -2.2 have been more egcs "safe" and egcs tends to work
well for a bunch of people, but it isn't guaranteed.  When people find
a problem (which is problem #1:  not all problems may have been found)
and get past the finger-pointing stage (problem #2), then they've got
to get a patch past Linus that fixes it in an acceptable way (problem #3).
