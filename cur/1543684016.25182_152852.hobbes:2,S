Hi,
	I was looking at pid.c file and can't understand pid_max usage.
It's defined as integer (signed) =PID_MAX_DEFAULT (which is 0x8000 (on old
arch, integer max positive value isn't 32767 ? so 0x8000 -> -32768).
	In alloc_pidmap, 'if (pid>=pid_max)' should be in that case always
true so pid=RESERVED_PIDS which is 300 (?).Why not use pid>PID_MAX_DEFAULT
there and forget the pid_max definition ? and why do we have that '300'
value ?
Regards,
Fabian
