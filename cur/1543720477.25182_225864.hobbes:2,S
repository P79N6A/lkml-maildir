In the case in question it's very much _not_ a performance issue. We're
writing a buffer to FLASH memory. The time it takes to read the word
from RAM is entirely lost in the noise compared with the time it takes
to write it to the flash.
Most of the time the buffer passed to the flash write routines will be
word-aligned. Occasionally it'll be unaligned but since there's a
distinct correlation between those arches on which we can't do fixups
and those machines on which flash is primary storage, putting
get_unaligned() in is a _correctness_ issue. And I don't care that it
might be slightly slower in the common case; as I said, it's in the
noise.

Not just old ARM chips. Some new chips too; especially MMU-less ones.

Yes. That's why I suggested we should have two forms -- for 'possibly'
and 'probably' unaligned.

Yes. That's why I was told to remove our current get_unaligned() from
the flash drivers. I'm perfectly happy to put it back.
