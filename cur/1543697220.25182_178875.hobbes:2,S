Hi wli,
how about utilising asm-generic/vmlinux.h.S now that you are touching so
many .lds files?
Something like the attached could be used?
That will simplify and consolidate the the .lds files, but full
flexibility remains.
I noticed that there were small diferences between the individual
architectures, but specifying only content of the section should allow
it to be used all over.
