Don't lose sight of the fact that you are only trying to find the extent
of physical RAM. And you are trying to do this before you set up your
page tables. ioremap() is very much after the fact. Note that, as I
explained, you must set DS to point to a data selector that does
1:1 flat addressing with no limit, and marked present. You can set the
base address to 1 megabyte if you want to exclude the usual ROMs and the
screen regen buffer, etc.
At one time I was concerned about cache-effects so I wrote a unique word
to every possible page in RAM (4GB), then attempted to read them all back.
The problem is that many/most/all?  PCs don't properly decode 4GB so I was
trashing code and stack. The solution was to do as stated. Just ignore the
cache. It works. If you were to read/write every byte/word/whatever in
memory sequentially, it would not work. Only the cache data would be
modified and you would subsequentally read from the cache. Just try it.
Another thing to consider is that offsets in ix86-land are signed!
Using [EBX] will address 4GB, but [buffer + EBX] will not. If EBX =
0xffffffff, (-1) it points to 1 byte below 'buffer'. This is something
to remember if you are trying to write 'cute' code. This is also something
to remember if you are relying on 'C' to compute the address. I strongly
suggest you find the RAM in assembly, not 'C'.
