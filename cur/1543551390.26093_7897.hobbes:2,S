The loop device does not support any metadata. Such stuff 
has to be stored somewhere else. If you want metadata in your loop 
encryption module you can just supply it with a private ioctl from losetup.
I don't think such policy belongs in the main loop device, it already
carries enough cruft.
[if you wanted a loop device that supports metadata I would wait for
the new LVM IBM promised to release someday -- it'll apparently
support such things. But a simple user space solution looks cleaner
to me for now.] 
Also the sector number AFAIK works fine as an IV as long as you use a cipher
with a sufficiently big block size (e.g. one of the AES candidates
with 128bit blocks). With short block sizes predictible IV is a bigger
problem.
