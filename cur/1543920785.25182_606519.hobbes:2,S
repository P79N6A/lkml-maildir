StGIT indeed creates empty commits (don't think there is anything
wrong with that specific version). Even the most basic command, "stg
new", creates an empty commit which is than filled with changes via
"stg refresh". Pushing patches may result in empty commits if a patch
was merged upstream. Failing import also leaves an empty commit if the
patch doesn't apply cleanly (and there is a .stgit-failed.patch file
left).
The "stg series -e" shows the empty patches and "stg clean" removes
them but I wouldn't do this automatically as empty patches are allowed
in StGIT, though in general for a limited time. I'll try to add
warning/error to commands like "mail" or "export" to make the user
aware.
