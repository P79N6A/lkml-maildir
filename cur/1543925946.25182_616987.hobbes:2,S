I think there are three strategies you can use in this case:
- create a kernel config that is as simple as possible, but still supports
  your hardware and reproduces your problem; a simpler config will often
  avoid compilation issues in parts of the kernel that you're not using
  anyway and has the benefit of speeding up the compiles too
- if you know/suspect in what part of the tree the bug is, first limit the
  bisection to that; you will have to verify that you did indeed find the
  correct (broken) change by doing a compile for the "last good commit + 1"
- if you find a broken commit, use 'git-reset --hard' to try to jump past
  the bad set of commits, but of course that does not help in the case:
    g version-bad
    f unrelated bug corrected
    e
    d the broken commit that caused your problem
    c
    b unrelated bug that breaks compilation or system introduced
    a version-good
  in that case the best you can reasonably be expected to do is report that
  you narrowed it down to "between a and g" and leave the rest to the
  developers
