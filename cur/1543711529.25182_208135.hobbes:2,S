Hi,
I just notice vmware running in kernel 2.6.4 has much higher cpu usage than
2.4.23-aa2. 35% compared to 3 to 5% when vmware doesn't do anything. If I run
getright (a downloader for windoz) cpu usage is around 50% and many others progs
become a bit slugish. In 2.4.23-aa2 the usage is only 13 to 15%. the vmware
I used is at version 3. Is it because of the new vmmon modules? I notice the
size of the modules is much bigger though, for 2.6 it is around 100Kb for
2.4 I use the original vmware modules ; only 30Kb.
Is this behavior normal or should I do something to help the debuging?
best regards,
Steve Kieu
