hi,
i got a new ibm intellistation z pro dual xeon (6221-49G) with on board 
Fusion MPT chipset (LSI53C1030) and fast U160 disks.
2.4.20-8 (redhat) and 2.6.0-test9-vanilla 
(each customer compiled minimal kernels) 
both yield very poor disk performance.
i didn't do specific benkchmarking, but mv'ing a 3GB $HOME to another
partition takes at least 4x the time as on my old P4 workstation with
IDE drive.
is poor performance with this controller a known problem?
could that have to do something with smp?
in 2.6.0, the driver's cvs-versions seem to match the ones in the
sources offered by LSI for download.
lkml-archives and google weren't all too helpful.
any info/help apreciated,
 / karl
PS: in the course of this i studied dmesg and found:
  calibrating APIC timer ...
  ..... CPU clock speed is 3066.0234 MHz.
  ..... host bus clock speed is 133.0314 MHz.
is 'host bus clock speed' != front side bus speed?
this shows up also on other p4 machines with much faster FSB than 133
mhz.
