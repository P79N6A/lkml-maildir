I've experienced the same problem too, on Dual PentiumIII/500MHz
with Intel EtherExpressPro 10/100 Ethernet (10Mbps) and Digital
DS21140 (Tulip, 10Mbps) in 2.2.10 kernel, while running RealServer.
At that time, we got around 3000 ms delay by ping on DS21140 NIC.
After upgraded 2.2.12, it works fine now.
