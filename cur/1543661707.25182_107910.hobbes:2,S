   OK, now I'm really getting confused.  Every other example I can find in
   the networking code, and every scatter-gather capable driver, uses
   skb->len as the full length and skb->len - skb->data_len as the length
   of the first or linear portion.
Indeed, Alan you need to fix the skb_padto stuff to use
skb->len, ignore the skb->data_len as skb->len is the
full length.
Sorry for telling you to do the wrong thing Alan, my bad :)
