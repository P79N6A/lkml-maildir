I added default whiteout file operations. So calling
init_special_inode() seems to make sense.
I know the ext2/ext3 whiteout patches are not really where they should
be. I plan to use a reserved inode number to reflect the case that the
inode itself doesn't have any attributes itself. It makes sense to
have a singleton whiteout inode per superblock.
