I want to experiment with development kernels and still keep my 
original, good working kernel (SuSE 6.1 self-compiled), so i altered 
the makefile of the development kernel to install the kernel in 
/dboot, so that i can have my old one in /boot. Then i added the 
necessary lines to lilo.conf and told it that a secondary kernel 
/dboot/vmlinuz exists.
Problem turns out to be, that when i boot the development kernel 
(the normal one works fine), the module info is loaded from 
/boot/system.map instead of /dboot/system.map, so the version is 
different and this results in an error.
My question now is how i could prevent that happening and what 
everybody else is doing. I don't have the option of installing the 
other kernel in another partition or something like that, just a 
directory.
I hope this is not to far from the linux kernel mailing list issues, but 
i don't have any idea where to ask otherwise and it is definatly 
kernel related. If you think this is wrong in here, please send me a 
note, telling me where to look for this information.
