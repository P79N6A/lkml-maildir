Disagree.
a) `jiffies' and `timepsec' are hardly "details".  They are basic
   kernel-wide concepts.  timespecs are even known to userspace.  Exporting
   a helper function which converts from one to the other is perfectly
   reasonable.
b) jiffies_to_timespec() was previously available to modules.  We
   changed that without notice and we changed it *by accident*.  There was
   no intention to withdraw jiffies_to_timespec() from the
   available-to-modules API.
If we really wanted to withdraw jiffies_to_timespec() then we'd mark it
__deprecated_for_modules for a while, then withdraw it.  But there's no
earthly reason why we'd want to withdraw it: the export makes sense.
