printk does all this, usually.  It is synchronous, so when
it returns to your code, the text is on the screen.
The only exception to this is when you perform a printk
from within an interrupt handler *while* printk itself
is executing in non-interrupt context.  When this rare
situation occurs, the text is buffered, to be emitted
by the non-interrupt code before it returns to its caller.
If the printk-within-printk buffering is a problem for you,
(which I doubt) then you could disable interrupts while
running printk. Something like this:
