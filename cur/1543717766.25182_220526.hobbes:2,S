I'm wondering if this should be a configurable setting. Reminds me of older
programs asking if they should do something using the 'fast' or 'slow'
algorithm, even though results were identical.
If we trust the AES assembler code, and it is supposed to be faster on >586,
it should be the default on those CPUs as there is no gain in using the C version.
On the other hand, if we think there are situations when the new assembler
code won't be correct or faster, we should not merge it.
In any case, Kconfig does not seem the way to go.
