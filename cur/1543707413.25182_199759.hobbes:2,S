Please don't do this. At least copy intel-agp.c to
something new and throw out all the dozens of chipsets
that will never appear on ia32e.
Splitting agpgart up to seperate drivers allowed us
to stop adding cruft upon cruft with each generation
of chipsets.  I don't want to have to spend half of
2.7 decrufting agpgart again.
