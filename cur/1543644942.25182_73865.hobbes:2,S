It might be worth reminding people here that you cannot implement self
modifying code safely on x86 SMP systems without a lot of care. Several
common chips take a long walk off a short bus when the code they are
currently executing is modified as they execute it. Not just because of
write atomicity (which could be fixed) but because of hardware errata.
So if you are patching something that another cpu could be executing at
the same time - you already lost.
