Vishi, 
Thanks for you message.  Are you sure about your statement?
Here is why I ask.  You basically quoted me chmod(1).  But, I have also
found references that say that the kernel doesn't do what the sticky bit
was originally intended to:
quoted from:
chmod(1)
-- snip --
save program text on swap device (t),
-- snip --
quoted from:
http://archive.lug.boulder.co.us/bymonth/1998.09/msg00194.html
-- snip --
> What the heck is a sticky bit?
blah..
blah..
Eventually, when paged virtual memory became standard, kernels ignored the
sticky bit on files, but the name remained for the use of the bit on
directories.
-- snip --
I was wondering if anyone knows "for sure" (TM) if linux 2.2 does infact
keep the file in memory when the sticky bit is set.  Being that the man
page for chmod and this list serv message are contradictory, that is why I
asked.
Thanks,
-jeremy brand
