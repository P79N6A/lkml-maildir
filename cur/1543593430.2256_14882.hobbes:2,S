Nicely spotted.  The X3201-3 Software Specification says nothing about
the segment bits for the filter, instead the information is tucked away
in the 21143 PCI/CardBus 10/100Mb/s Ethernet LAN Controller Hardware
Reference Manual.  So Xircom have a software specification manual that
does not include the full software spec, oh the horrors.
