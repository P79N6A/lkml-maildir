Sure, if people want to use these.
I did not push them because they seemed a bit "heavy weight",
but the construct is useful and general.
The docs should explain that the purpose is to wait atomically on
a complex condition, and that the usage pattern is to hold the
lock when using the wait_event_* functions or when changing any
variable that might affect the condition and waking up the waiting
processes.
