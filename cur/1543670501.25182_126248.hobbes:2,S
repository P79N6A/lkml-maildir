 Many drivers currently include this same data in kernel space, in in
 headers, what I am trying to do is make it easy for them to support
 fwfs (or whatever it becomes in the end). This way, they may be able to
 support it with little effort (which increases the chances of them
 actualy supporting it) and people worried about memory usage can easly
 free up that memory with a simple unlink.

 When sysfs binary support is integrated I'll try to do something on top
 of it, and in any case, I'll at the minimum make sure that in-kernel
 data is optional.
 Have a nice day
