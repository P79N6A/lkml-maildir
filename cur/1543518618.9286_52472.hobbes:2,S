For portability or for performance. You have a choice of exactly one API
for threading portably on Unix. It isnt a brilliant API but it works. So 
people use it

Because it is portable.

And SuS also is far from perfect. Its a hacked together ratification of 
evolved behaviour. In places it reminds me of the cobol 2000 spec although
thankfully it hasnt gone quite that far. 
Supporting SuS is important (except for really sick crap like streams), but
optimising for the sillier cases is questionable to say the least. Linux
doesn't meet all the SuS atomicity of reads v writes guarantees for 
example.

It doesnt require fixed size stacks. It might require the allocator places
the intelligently to leave suitable holes.

Segment overrides are x86 only. Your point ?

When I'm watching a DVD on Linux there are five threads switching at a high
rate. I think thats not atypical. A measurable chunk of the linux clone
thread performance comes from totally shared page tables, no tlb flushes
and misses.

For small lists you can do this.

It isnt an error to hit the extra page. If you have expandable stacks then
you have to be able to fulfill the expansion. Ultimately that means all 
stack usage has to be blocking.  That or your stacks are only "kind of"
growable and it blows up by magic if you get it wrong.
Switching to a virtually contiguous stack in order to get guard pages is
a possible good plan for the future. (Right now people still DMA off the
stack although the department of shooting people is working on this issue)

Exporting code is a useful one. We can export the same code to all. Similarly
the time of day and the like can be globally exported because they are shared.
Every thread on the system has the same time.
That gives you all sorts of benefits - especially the code hooks, but without
the extra cost of page tables, tlb abuse and the like.
