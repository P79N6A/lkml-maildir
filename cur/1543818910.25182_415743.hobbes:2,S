Trond,
Could you point out the particular commit, or the patch from your patch
series?
[On Tuesday, I tried linux-2.6.16-NFS_ALL on a host that is re-exporting
a NetApp NFS mount via Samba, and I got thousands of file locks that
weren't released, so I had to discard NFS_ALL for now, until I have time
to look closer.]
