It isn't that expensive to put 1 gigabit port on many modern 100mbit
switches. However, many company networks are arranged so that the
servers plug into N separate 100mbit switches.
But this points out a bit of the unreality of the test. If you're
thinking about someone serving web pages to the Internet, I assure you
that 400 megabits of bandwidth costs a hell of a lot more than 1 4-cpu
PC. Or two. Or ten.
