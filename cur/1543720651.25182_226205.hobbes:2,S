Karsten, Kai,
while I agree that this is a measurement bug, it's not exacly fun to
look at the code in question.  Can you please find a solution for
hscx_irq.c?
Either transform it into a header and uninline some of the longer
functions or make the functions global and add the necessary header
and Makefile-line.  In any case, I don't like to see something like
#include "hscx_irq.c"
stackframes for call path too long (268435490):
    size  function
       0  IsdnCardState->irq_func
268435466  teles3_interrupt
      24  hscx_empty_fifo
       0  read_fifo
       0  insb
Jörn
