Sorry, but if you don't have procfs compiled in and you want to
remount one of your partitions read-only, how do you do it? I see why
limitation is there, but I would not call it reasonable.
If one of your nfs servers died horrible death, how do you umount it?
Yes, there are some opened handles. They should not matter.
