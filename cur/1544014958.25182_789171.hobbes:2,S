I agree that the idea is useful. But to me it seems to a bit
artificial that you still have to mount some kind of subsystem purely
to get the grouping, and that you can only have one such grouping.
I think I'd prefer the ability to mount a cgroups hierarchy without
*any* subsystems (maybe with "-o none"?) which would give you a
similar effect, but without you needing to know about a special no-op
subsystem, and would allow you to have multiple "no-op" groupings.
