i forgot to mention though that i do use jack in full duplex mode and with a
periodsize of 64:
/usr/bin/jackd -R -P60 -t20000 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r48000 -p64 -n2
The results are thus not really comparable. Anyways, 7ms xruns still
shouldn't happen (with the older VP patches i could run 32 frames full
duplex for hours w/o xruns).
