Subject: [ANNOUNCE] kernel v2.0.40-pre1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is the first pre-patch of 2.0.40. It mainly cleans up some stuff
and adds a few useful scripts. I've also added an extra-version entry
to the KERNELRELEASE. If this causes any trouble, please let me know.
I intend to do quite some cleanup of the kernel-source; my goal is to
make it compile with gcc-3.x. This does _NOT_ mean that gcc-3.x will
produce a working kernel, at least not on x86, but the code needs
some fixups none-the-less; the #endif-fixes are the first changes in
this direction. Enjoy (?)
Later v2.0.40-prepatches will also see whitespace-fixes and fixes of
at least the most horrid uses of code-formatting. My reasoning here
is consistency and making it easier to use the v2.0-kernel for
educational purposes, and to simplify my own maintainance work. Feel
free to complain. I _might_ care, but I most probably won't :^)
This release is dedicated to all the victims of the terror-attacks
vs the United States on the 11th of September 2001.
