Argg, I didn't thought at that, now I understood the point... But I am
pretty sure we can continue to do async swapout also from the process
path. I think it works fine because now swapout is only a bank credit. It
works faster obviously because the process doesn't need to block and so
requesting many swapout at one time will drammatically improve swapout
I/O performances... 
I am going to re-insert the poor kswapd now ;)
Thanks.
