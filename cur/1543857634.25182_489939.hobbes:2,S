Yes, hence the bit-stuffing, you're right :).  And hence this period 
isn't really too stressful for the controller as the stuffed bits come 
relatively often.
We're hoping that any wire-errors get picked up by the CRC anyway so a 
marginal cable under any circumstances shouldn't silently corrupt data. 
  I love that word 'shouldn't' ;)
