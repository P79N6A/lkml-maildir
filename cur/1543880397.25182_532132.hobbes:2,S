As I said earlier, are there any flags currently that if not propagated 
can lead to conflicts with the shared subtree semantics? I am not aware
of any.  If you did notice a case, than according to me its a bug.
But the new proposed 'allow unpriviledged mounts' flag; if not
propagated among peers (and slaves) of a shared mount can lead to
conflicts with shared subtree semantics. Since mount in one
shared-mount; when propagated to its peer fails to mount and hence lead
to un-identical peers.

Making mounts read-only or read-write -- will that effect mount
propagation in such a way that future mounts in any one of the
peers will not be able to propagate that mount to its peers or slaves?
I don't think it will. Hence its ok to selectively mark some mounts
read-only and some mounts read-write.
However with the introduction of unpriviledged mount semantics, there 
can be cases where a user has priviledges to mount at one location but
not at a different location. if these two location happen to share
a peer-relationship than I see a case of interference of read-write
flag semantics with shared subtree semantics. And hence we will end up
propagating the read-write flag too or have to craft a different
semantics that stays consistent.

As I said earlier, I see a case where two mounts that are peers of each
other can become un-identical if we dont propagate the "allowusermnt".
As a practical example.
/tmp and /mnt are peers of each other.
/tmp has its "allowusermnt" flag set, which has not been propagated
to /mnt.
now a normal-user mounts an ext2 file system under /tmp at /tmp/1
unfortunately the mount wont appear under /mnt/1 
and this breaks the shared-subtree semantics which promises: whatever is
mounted under /tmp will also be visible under /mnt
and in case if you allow the mount to appear under /mnt/1, you will
break unpriviledge mounts semantics which promises: a normal user will
not be able to mount at a location that does not allow user-mounts.
