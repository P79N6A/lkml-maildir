I did this for nettools (i.e. ifconfig), too:
          RX bytes:2120660294 (1.9 GiB)  TX bytes:341183013 (325.3 MiB)
man page:
       Since net-tools 1.60-4 ifconfig is printing byte  counters
       with  SI  units. So 1 KiB are 2^10 byte. Note, the numbers
       are truncated to one decimal (which can by quite  a large
       error if you consider 0.1 PiB is 112.589.990.684.262 bytes :)
