Not always possible.  In the case of PCMCIA, we've had to run things
asynchronously because of the #$@$#@ driver model locking issues -
otherwise adding a PCI (cardbus) device while we're in the probe for
the yenta device deadlocked.
I suspect other subsystems also suffered from this, which unfortunately
makes your otherwise good idea a pipedream.
