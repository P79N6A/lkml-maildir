bonnie,tiobench,dbench would be a very good start for the basics (note:
dbench can be misleading, but at the same fariness levels, it's
interesting too, it's just that dbench doesn't measure the fariness
level itself [like tiobench started doing relatively recently]).
(I'm assuming the patch makes difference not only for mmapped dirty
pages, in such case the above would be non interesting)
thanks,
Andrea
