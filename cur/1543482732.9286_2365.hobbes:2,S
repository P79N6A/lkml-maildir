I am a relative newbie and I've exhausted every resource I can think of
for trying to figure this out. If this is not the appropriate place for
this topic, please advise me of where I should turn! Without further
ado...
After installing 2.2.0 (final), I receive the following messege upon
reboot:
Kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k binfmt-464c, errno=8
request_module[binfmt-464c]: fork failed, errorno=11
This messege scrolls endlessly. I've double and triple checked my kernel
configuration, and I've redone the modules, but I can't seem to figure
this one out. Thanks for any assistence or pointers!
