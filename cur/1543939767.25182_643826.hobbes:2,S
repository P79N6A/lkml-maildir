Yeah, my bad. :( I thought this was new, but it was just not exposed by
my scripts because of the EHEA build errors (they were actual compile
errors, while this was a link error, so it never go this far). That's
why I didn't see it in -rc8-mm1 and thought it was new.

Hmm, they are already on a bus. Odd, must be done like this for legacy
reasons.

Alright, I'll leave that to people who care about vio and can test the
proper fix. After a quick glance it looks like it should be easy to use
bus_find_device() for it instead.
