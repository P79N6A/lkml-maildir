The way we turn on and off mcount function calls at run time is through
mcount_enable.  I'll look into why this is broken for you. I'm able to run
with this. My box is a ppc64, and my ppc32 (powerbook) wont come close to
booting RT (never did).  On boot up it locks up right away and the screen
looks like it starts to melt. No serial, so I don't have much to debug
that with.
Anyway, I'll take a deeper look into this.
