Ok, a better test would be with a _lot_ of devices.  Care to test with a
lot of scsi debug devices?

Every kobject that is created and is associated with a subsystem
generates a hotplug call.  So that's about every kobject that we care
about here :)

Can you show this happening?

No, I don't think the additional ones you have added will cause
problems, but can you verify this?  Just log all hotplug events
happening in your system (point /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug to a simple
logging program).
But again, I don't think the added overhead you have added to a kobject
is acceptable for not much gain for the normal case (systems without a
zillion devices.)
