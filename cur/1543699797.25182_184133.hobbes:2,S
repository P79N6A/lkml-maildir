sii chips have a long history of needing to
hdparm off the unmask interrupt feature.
I don't know about that chip but for
sii680 there is a special option "-p9"
for hdparm which is to say pio mode 9
is a special instruction in addition to
standard hdparm opt "-u0" turning off
irq unmask.
/sbin/hdparm -d1 -c1 -p9 -X70 -u0 -k0 -i $a
also the sii sata chips can have the kernel config
low-level scsi driver CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=y
which you should read about in this list archive.
I don't personally know about that.
