Sure. I did not say lets disable it. I was hopping we could and I wanted to see what Rusty 
Russell has to say about this.

Yes it is. I missed a few. Nick and Dave already pointed out CPU hotplug. 
I looked around and found more users. So disabling stop machine completely is definitely out.

I'm considering that option. So far it does not seem practical. At least the way we use those
machines at this point. If we can prove that at least not halting isolation CPUs is safe that'd
be better.
