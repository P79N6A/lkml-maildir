       - one key observation: let bugs "expire" much like news expires.  If
         nobody has been whining enough that it gets into the high signal 
         bug db then it probably isn't real.  We really want a way where no
         activity means let it expire.
I want more than time based expiry, I want expiry for me that
is controlled by me.  When I delete the notification email in
my mailbox, I never want to see that bug again unless I want to.
This effectively degrades into list posting based bug reports and my
current email inbox, which is what I'm advocating to use :-)
When I see the "me too, heres some more info" response to the list
posting, then I'm interested and I'll reread the list thread to
digest all the information to see what I can make of it.  When this
happens bugs basically fix themselves, and this occurs only because
of the acts taken on by the reporters of the bug not me.
