I checked prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/glibc/ and there I only can find
        -rw-r--r--   1 ftp      ftp            86 Feb 11 16:25 glibc-2.1-README
saying
        glibc-2.1 has been (temporarily) removed, until some
        political issues are worked out.
so, when will glibc 2.1 really be available and which "political issues"
have to be worked out (for more than a month now) ?
