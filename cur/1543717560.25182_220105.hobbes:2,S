Andrew tells me that he is OK with reserving a syscall number for
kexec, which is easy & quick.  I don't know when vdso will be available
(for non-x86[2]) or when the AT_SYSINFO data will work for userlevel
code[1. above].
So is there any reason not to reserve the syscall number for kexec
for now?  (patch is below)

[2] kexec is currently only available for x86, but there is interest
in it for ia64 and ppc64 at least.
