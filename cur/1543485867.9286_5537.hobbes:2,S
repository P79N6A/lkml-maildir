On the second thought... Execute permissions on a directory are needed
only to access files referenced from it. All we need to change is the
contents of directory, not inodes referenced from it. It's ?w?, not ?wx.
Other implementations also ignore execute permissions happily (and do
require write permissions). I don't have POSIX right now, but I've looked
into SUS2 and it also speaks only about wrte permissions. So I'm reverting
the change.
