Unfortunately I can't reproduce easily :(. I just passed 5 minutes trying
inserting, mounting, find /cdrom, unmounting many different cd without
success. It happened when one cdrom started to make mess into the
cd-driver.
But could explain your theory? According to me if you had an irq pending
you should have all the time to run it at __sti() time without the need
of udelay(2).
