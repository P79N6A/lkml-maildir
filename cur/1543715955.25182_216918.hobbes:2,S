Subject: PCI problem with RICOH RL5C475 PCI/PCMCIA adapter, on 2.4.26
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I have PCI-PCMCIA adapter (Ricoh RL5C475 based) in a desktop machine.
Initially, I had problems making it work, but managed to get help on
comp.os.linux.portable. Now, most of the cards work okay.
However, I still have one wireless PCMCIA card (Prism GT based) which
doesn't work, and was advised to post the problem here.
Dave (from comp.os.linux.portable) said:
"This part is a tricky one.  It is a bug in the kernel's PCI resource
allocation code.  It tries to allocate CardBus memory resources from
whatever memory ranges happened to be allocated for the bridge device
by the BIOS at power-up time; but in this case, those memory windows
are too small.  There isn't a simple fix for this and I don't have a
good suggestion for what to do about it; you can report it on the
linux-kernel mailing list."
cardmgr starts okay, and when I insert the card, I get:

Kernel is 2.4.26, running on nForce2 based motherboard. Kernel is compiled
with CONFIG_HIMEM enabled, although same behaviour was with the same
option disabled.
Any help with this is much appreciated. I will provide more details, if
needed.
Thanks.
