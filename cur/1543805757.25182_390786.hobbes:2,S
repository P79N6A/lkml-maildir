Maybe I am doing something wrong but Mesa is awfully slow.
I don't need highend acceleration but I can't even play tuxracer.
Maybe I missed something???
gl-info says:
 GL_VENDOR = "Mesa project: www.mesa3d.org"
 GL_RENDERER = "Mesa GLX Indirect"
 GL_VERSION = "1.3 Mesa 4.0.4"
 GL_EXTENSIONS = "GL_ARB_imaging GL_ARB_multitexture GL_ARB_texture_border_clamp GL_ARB_texture_cube_map GL_ARB_texture_env_add GL_ARB_texture_env_combine GL_ARB_texture_env_dot3 GL_ARB_transpose_matrix GL_EXT_abgr GL_EXT_blend_color GL_EXT_blend_minmax GL_EXT_blend_subtract GL_EXT_texture_env_add GL_EXT_texture_env_combine GL_EXT_texture_env_dot3 GL_EXT_texture_lod_bias "

yep, just like nvidias drivers.  I had very bad experiences with them.
Thanks,
