i did an strace on gqmpeg and xawtv ..this is what gqmpeg showed when
trying to play a file
select(9, [8], NULL, NULL, {0, 0})      = 1 (in [8], left {0, 0})
read(8, "c", 1)                         = 1
select(9, [8], NULL, NULL, {0, 0})      = 1 (in [8], left {0, 0})
read(8, "e", 1)                         = 1
select(9, [8], NULL, NULL, {0, 0})      = 1 (in [8], left {0, 0})
read(8, "\n", 1)                        = 1
write(1, "Warning, unrecognized mpg123 out"..., 73Warning, unrecognized
mpg123 output:"shmget(): No space left on device")
) = 73
It showed the select and read commands a lot before finally giving up.
This is xawtv
select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL)        = 1 (in [3])
read(3, "\1\0\251\1\16\0\0\0/\0\0\0/\0\0\0\16\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0"..., 32)
= 32
read(3, "z\0\0\2B\f@\0D\f@\0F\f@\0H\f@\0J\f@\0L\f@\0N\f@\0"..., 56) = 56
write(3, "\17\0\2\0/\0\0\0", 8)         = 8
read(3, 0xbffff5dc, 32)                 = -1 EAGAIN (Resource
temporarily unavailable)
xawtv will still work but gqmpeg cannot run.   shget returns no memory
available on any app trying to access it.   Well, hope that tells
someone something because i'm stumped ..  something in shm seems
broken..  or the vm is.
