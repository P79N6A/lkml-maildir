Subject: Can't mount an ext3 partition - why?

Hello all,
maybe it's so easy... but I stuck on it:
I have a 2.4.18-3 pre-compiled kernel coming with an RH7.3
distribution. Running a system under it I create an ext-3 partition on
a secondary HDD (/dev/hdc1). All was fine, but now I have to recompile
my kernel with some new modules, and new kernel can't mount this! It
mounts my /dev/hda partitions (/, /boot and swap) without any
question, but /dev/hdc1 makes it stuck! fsck says, it has something
wrong on it... But old kernel mounts hdc1 silently, and I have no reason
to run fsck (I think).
Please tell me what I miss in the kernel config? Here's related part
of it:

PC is Intel Pentium II 233, hda is 4GB Fujitsy, hdc is 80GB Maxtor
(BIOS can't detect it, so in BIOS table I choose "none").
Any comments?
