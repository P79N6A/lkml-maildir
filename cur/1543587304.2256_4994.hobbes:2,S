I am not sure this is a serial driver bug:
[jgarzik@rum linux_2_4]$ find . -name '*.[ch]'|xargs grep -wn
SNDCTL_TMR_STOP
./arch/sparc64/kernel/ioctl32.c:3503:COMPATIBLE_IOCTL(SNDCTL_TMR_STOP)
./drivers/sound/mpu401.c:1522:          case SNDCTL_TMR_STOP:
./drivers/sound/sequencer.c:1352:               case SNDCTL_TMR_STOP:
./drivers/sound/sound_timer.c:195:              case SNDCTL_TMR_STOP:
./drivers/sound/sys_timer.c:206:        case SNDCTL_TMR_STOP:
./include/linux/soundcard.h:165:#define SNDCTL_TMR_STOP                
_SIO  ('T', 3)
