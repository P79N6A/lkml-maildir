well, the thing is, as nsproxy is working now, you
will get a new one (with a changed subset of entries)
every time a task does a clone() with one of the 
space flags set, which means, that you will end up
with quite a lot of them, but resource limits have
to address a group of them, not a single nsproxy
(or act in a deeply hierarchical way which is not
there atm, and probably will never be, as it simply
adds too much overhead)

on every limit accounting or check? I think that
is quite a lot of overhead ...
