The "Block layer" config option seems a bit out of place where it is now.
I would move it just before "Networking", but that requires touching
every architecture Kconfig file (just cloning the 'source net/Kconfig' line).
Is this the way to go ? Is it where it is for some reason apart from being
a fast way to let every arch load it ?
TIA
