	Hi,
I would like to hear your opinions about the patchset below (updated version
compared to yesterday, lkml added to the CC list).
The Cell Broadband Engine contains a 64-bit PowerPC core with 2 hardware
threads (called PPEs) and 8 Synergistic Processing Engines (called SPEs).
When booting Linux, 2 penguins logos are shown on the graphical console by
the standard frame buffer console logo code.
To emphasize the existence of the SPEs (which can be used under Linux), we
added a second row of (smaller) helper penguin logos, one for each SPE.
I attached a PNG version of the helper penguin logo for reference.
Summaries:
[PATCH 1/7] fbdev: Avoid vertical overflow when making space for the logo
[PATCH 2/7] fbdev: fb_do_show_logo() updates
[PATCH 3/7] fbdev: extract fb_show_logo_line()
[PATCH 4/7] fbdev: move logo externs to header file
[PATCH 5/7] fbdev: Add fb_append_extra_logo()
[PATCH 6/7] fbdev: SPE helper penguin logo
[PATCH 7/7] Cell: Draw SPE helper penguin logos
Thanks for your comments!
Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
