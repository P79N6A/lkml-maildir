It's hard to talk to you if you're not even trying to understand what
I'm trying to say. Andrew wanted to know what these plugins are. I tried
to give an answer and then you come along to tell me that it's not
relevant. Sure, Linux doesn't care about what the filesystem does
internally but Andrew wanted to know that.

Huh?
Now you're completely confusing me.
First you say that that file-as-a-directory is crap then you say that it
does belong into the filesystem?
I'll try again:
inode_operations, etc... are implemented as a "reiser4 plugin". This
means that reiser4 is usable as filesystem, you can store files in a
directory hierarchy. There's absolute nothing special here. Absolutely
nothing. And yes, reiser4 plugins are invisible from the VFS. It looks
like a normal filesystem because it behaves like one.
The "metas" I was referring in the second part are this file-as-a-
directory thing. These don't belong in the filesystem and should
therefore be removed.
The latter doesn't necessarily have anything to do with plugins.
The plugins are plugins for the storage layer, not for some semantic
enhancement.
Note that I changed the topic to avoid further confusion.
