the regualatory problems are not true.  they are completely focused on
the users.  Someone who wants to change it can always do it, may it be
by binary patching.  I don't know of a single country that forbids
implementing those bits in source code shipped, and in those countries
we alredy couldn't distribute the kernel.
A binary daemon is completely unacceptable and unless you fix that there
is zero chance the driver could get into mainline.  I'd also like to
urge the distributors to not put this crap in to weaken our free drivers
future.  Intel, please stop this madness and play by the rules.
