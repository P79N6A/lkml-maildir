I don't know how you reach this conclusion.  Can you explain?
I can see that if you never receive requests during holdoff then of
course you lose.  That's why you choose a very small holdoff time -- one
which is small compared with the expected seek time.  (E.g. 50 times
smaller).
I can also see that if you do receive some requests during holdoff, then
throughput can be much faster.  Explanation follows.

That's what I meant.  We agree -- there is no need for special elevator
logic to improve readahead :-)

Here's where I disagree.  Holdoff is proposed to take care of the
specific cases where readaround _doesn't_ work.  Holdoff doesn't help at
all when readaround is working ok.
This is for those cases where a program calls some function that needs
to be paged in (along with its supporting functions), and that pulls in
code and data from 20 different places in the executable.

Heh, testcases.  Let's stick to theory for today, ok? :-)
Putting pageins at the top of the queue isn't enough.  It doesn't
prevent seeks from dominating I/O time due to competition between
processes.
(Quite apart from "interactive", which IMO should be recognised and
given higher I/O priority for as long as they're classified that way).
Here's the theoretical example.
Scenario: I/O- and memory-loaded machine and you start Emacs.  Assume
readaround is "5" blocks for purpose of example, but Emacs likes to
touch pages spread of

This is the result.
Read sequence without holdoff: 30, 1000, 40, 1010, 20, 1020, 10, 1030, 50...
Read sequence with holdoff: 30, 40, 20, 10, 1000, 50, 1010, 1020, 1030...
Paging time:            holdoff wins.
  ...because it can cluster, the paging process runs faster.
Overall throughput:     holdoff wins.
  ...because of seek times, everyone gets better throughput.

You're right, readahead and readaround are pretty good.  But there are
definitely situations where they don't work too well.  Try starting
Netscape from cold cache with a few "find /"s running in the
background.  It's not too slow, but it's definitely slower.  I'd like
the finds to

Forget about indirect blocks.  You may have a point, but I don't care
about indirect blocks at all.  I'm thinking entirely about the
"interactive user experience under load", and that means things like
starting applications while the disk is busy.

Yeah.  It's happened before :-)
