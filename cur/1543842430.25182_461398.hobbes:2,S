Absolutely.  sys_init_module() should not return until the device nodes
have stabilised.  There is no other sane interface the kernel can offer.
ho hum.
Perhaps there's some hacklet we can put into modprobe, to allow it to peek
at the udev sequence numbering, wait until all the events which were
associated with this modprobe have been serviced?  Or maybe a standalone
tool?
Say, just a loopback message: send it into the kernel, knowing that it will
be appended to the queue.  Wait until a reply comes, so you know that all
preceding events in the queue have been serviced?
Or whatever.  Right now, there's no sane way to do
	modprobe rd
	mkfs /dev/ram0
so instead we could do
	modprobe rd
	/sbin/wait-for-udev-to-catch-up
	mkfs /dev/ram0
Or something.
