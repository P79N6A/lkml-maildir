... doesn't seem the same.
It appears that 2.4.22 may be better suited to penguin abuse than 2.6.1.
I rebooted my desktop to 2.4.22.  Within a minute,  I tied my record 
from the laptop.

Still, the results are far from scientific or conclusive.  I need some 
objective smackage.
Maybe I will try a blind study with my nieces tonight.  I'll reboot the 
machine into either 2.4.22 or 2.6.1 and record their scores.
Coming soon to a techie-site near you, "Pingumark 2004".
