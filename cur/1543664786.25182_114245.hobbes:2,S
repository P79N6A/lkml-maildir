The "weave", or order of csets, certainly changes each time Linus does a 
'bk pull'.  I wonder if a 'cset_order' file would be useful -- an 
automated job uses BK to export the weave for a specific point in time. 
  One could use that to glue the csets together, perhaps?
WRT cset numbers, ignore them.  Each cset has a unique key.  When 
setting up the 2.5 snapshot cron job, Linus asked me to export this key 
so that the definitive top-of-tree may be identified, regardless of cset 
number.  Here is an example:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/snapshots/patch-2.5.63-bk6.key
