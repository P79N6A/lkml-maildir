By the same argument VMS is not an enterprise system, because above IPL
2 (the level at which the bulk of the kernel runs), you only have
cooperative, not preemptive, scheduling, and above IPL 3 you can't
reschedule at all.  Same as on Linux (where the global kernel lock and
the other spinlocks impose similar scheduling constraints).
Sheesh.
This is a feature, not a problem.  A fully preemptive kernel is
necessary for true realtime, NOT for a server OS.  Excessive preemption
requries extra locking and it craps up the use of the CPU caches,
resulting in overall poorer throughput for a server OS.

No longer true on 2.2, and although there are still significant bits of
the kernel which _are_ serialised, these are getting reduced release by
release.
