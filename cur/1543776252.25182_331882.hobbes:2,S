Alan Cox has sent fixes for some of the problems in sg to one of the 
maintainers, but they don't seem to be in mainline. Perhaps he could 
send them to akpm and see if he is interested in fixing problems. Once 
the problem with error reporting is fixed (and that may not be the fix 
Alan has devised) by someone then paranoia can get rid of the egregious 
hack.
I've expanded the recipients list, perhaps we'll get a status on (a) if 
the fix Alan has will cause correct error reporting, and (b) when it can 
be put in mainline. The paranoia can clean up its act.
