>Ok, the second try.
This patch appears to work well. No snd_es1371 traces in over 25 minutes
of testing (I had a couple hundred yesterday in similar tests). The sound
was OK as well.
I am seeing some additional CPU overhead during the disk I/O tests with
today's kernel but I don't think this is due to this patch.
Thanks.
