Ok, replacing 2.4.0-test4's drivers/parport directory with 2.4.0-test4-pre4's
fixes the problem, too. -pre5 and -pre6 have the same contents in drivers/
parport, and I first experienced the problem in -pre6, so the bug almost
certainly originated in a change in -pre5.
At this point I'll have to stop and leave it up to others to actually fix
the bug.
