Which I am, extensively, but not on the repo that got damaged.  That's
why I was wondering about the nlink issues.  If I qpop a bunch of
patches after just pushing them, won't it simply truncate the file?
The repo which got damaged is the one I pull kernel.org/linux-2.6 into,
and use it as a source for clone/pull into my actual working repos.

Appears to be on a delta boundary, exactly 47 revisions short:
