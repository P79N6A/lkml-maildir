If I understand Alan properly, we don't always have choice, some BIOSes
will do it anyway...

It is now already ! I don't think we will _ever_ get ATI and nVidia
provide enough documentation to POST all chip models (which isn't always
possible without knowledge of every single way the chip is wired on a
each board).
Currently, I cannot implement suspend-to-RAM on the latest PowerBooks
because of that (they use nVidia chip that are powered down and not just
unclocked unlike earlier ATI based models) because of that. Nor can I
implement it on any other "desktop" Mac.

When I finally have an implementation of an OF runtime so I can re-POST
the card, I could eventually have the driver itself call this to explicitely
ask for a re-POST...
