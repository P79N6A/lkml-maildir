It fscking doesn't.  He had clearly said that he calls file->f_op->read(),
which has nothing whatsofuckingever to descriptors.  Sod off and don't
return until you learn to read.
As for the original question - grep fro set_fs and you'll see what to
do (basically, set_fs(KERNEL_DS) before the call of ->read() and restore
afterwards).
