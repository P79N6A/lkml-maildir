again I don't agree. I would say that do_munmap() decides which
address range will use the new allocated vma object. split_vma() get
this information through its parameter named "new_below".

not really. I'm not writing a real driver. I just try to understand
how vma things work in Linux. Therefore I just wrote a dumb driver
which has modified vma open/close method in order to detect how these
method are called.
I end up to see "open(B), close(B)" sequence when unmapping a part of
the dumb device that I found strange. I think that "open(A') close(B)"
can give more information to the driver and reflect that B is unmapped
and A' is still mapped and becomes the new mapped area.
But it's may be just me...
