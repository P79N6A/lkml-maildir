That's exactly what I found through experimentation.

Hints for,
* sequential read
* sequential write
* sequential write, where the application considers the data it's 
writing to be unlikely to be read again any time soon (hopefully 
implying to the page cache that these pages have low value as cacheable 
objects)
* some sort of streaming hints, implying that the application cares a 
lot about maintaining some minimum i/o rate.  note I said hint, not 
requirement.  -not- guaranteed-rate-IO.
I might even go so far as to advocate identifying common usage patterns, 
and creating hint constants for them, even if we don't support them in 
the kernel immediately (if ever).  Makes the interface much more 
future-proof, at the expense of a few integers in a 32-bit numberspace, 
and a few more bytes in the C compiler's symbol table.
