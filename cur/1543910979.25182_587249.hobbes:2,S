Hi!

No, I do not think I like that. I believe both -> control and -> crc
is just useless paranoia. Bitflip in this area is not going to be any
worse than bitflip anywhere else, we should not pretend this is
somehow "more important".
-> control should really be "protocol version"... probably should
contain some field that is easy to increment.
