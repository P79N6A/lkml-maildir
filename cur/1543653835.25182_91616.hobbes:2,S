It looks good enough.  The only irritating part is turning the "S3 
Inc. Trio 64 3D" or "ACPI Tables" back into the numberic e820 type.  I 
accomplished this in the previous patch by removing the printing of 
the name completely.  I thought it was silly to have the kernel 
printing out a pretty name just to have the userspace program parse it 
back into a number.  It saved a bug hunk of code in both the kernel 
and the kexec utility to skip the name.
What would you think of just adding another field to /proc/iomem which 
contains the e820 field type?  I've never seen any userspace use of 
iomem, but I would imagine that things like kudzu use it.  I wonder if 
they'll get tripped up if
50000000-50000fff : Texas Instruments PCI1450
changes into something like
50000000-50000fff : 2 : Texas Instruments PCI1450

I posted one this morning.
