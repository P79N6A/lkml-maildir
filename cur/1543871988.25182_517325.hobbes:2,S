I wonder if bitmapping a raid1 volume is faster than bmp.ing raid5.
The other thing is, the bitmap is supposed to be written out at intervals,
not at every write, so the extra head movement for bitmap updates should
be really low, and not making the tar -xjf process slower by half a
minute.
Is there a way to tweak the write-bitmap-to-disk interval? Perhaps 
something in /sys or ye olde /proc. Maybe linux-raid@ knows 8)

Huh? That statement does not make sense. But I think you meant: when using
external bitmaps, adjust the init scripts. Because internal bitmaps are good
for one thing: you don't need to change anything.
