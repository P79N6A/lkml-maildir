I just built this to see how much blood it would draw, which isn't 
much.  I don't have jack here, so I don't have your standard torture 
test.  Instead, I run tvtime, which runs at a -19 priority.
I let it run about 30 seconds (untimed), noted that the frame error 
slippage wasn't improved, and got this output histogram when I quit 
it.
Its (tvtime) is running here of course.

--------------------
And I note that the 1-26 column of numbers does not seem to add up to 
whats being logged above there, which are all 21 and 22 ms bumps 
(whatever a bump is)
Is this a helpfull report, or just noise?  Subjectively, tvtime is 
running with far fewer visible frame glitches than before I started 
playing with these patches.  A marked improvement IMO.
