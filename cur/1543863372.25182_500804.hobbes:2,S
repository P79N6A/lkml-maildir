When you unmap and map you must currently get exclusive access to the 
cachelines of the pte and the cacheline of the page struct. If we use a 
list_move on page->lru then we have would have to update pointers in up 
to 4 other page structs. Thus we need exclusive access to 4 additional 
cachelines. This triples the number of cachelines touched. Instead of 2 
cachelines we need 6.
