thanks for the pointer. I wasn't aware of this draft (although from a 
reasonably short search it appears that this draft was allowed to expire, 
with no direct replacement that I could find)
I will say that this wasn't what I thought we was being talked about for 
cluster membership, becouse I assumed that the generation of an ID would 
be repeatable so that a cluster node could be rebuilt and re-join the 
cluster with it's old ID.
