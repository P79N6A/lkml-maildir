I think we have two alternatives here - both have some problems.
1. make ->prepare_flush_fn return some code to tell blk layer skip
   the flush as the original code did.
This is what you're proposing, I guess.  The reason why I'm reluctant
to take this approach is that there still remains window of error
between #3 and #4.  The flush requests could already be prepared and
in the queue when ->wcache is turned off.  AFAICS, the original code
had the same problem, although the window was narrower.
2. complete flush commands successfully in execute_drive_cmd() if wcache
   is not enabled.
This approach fixes all cases but the implementation would be a bit
hackish.  execute_drive_cmd() will have to look at the command and
ide_disk->wcache to determine if a special command should be completed
successfully without actually executing it.  Maybe we can add a
per-HL-driver callback for that.
Bartlomiej, I'm not really sure about both of above approaches.  My
humble opinion is that benefits brought by both of above aren't worth
the added complexity.  The worst can happen is a few IDE command
failures caused by executing flush command on a wcache disabled drive.
And that would happen only when the user turns off wcache while
barrier sequence is *in progress*.
Hmmm... What do you think?  It's your call.  I'll do what you choose.

Can you get the patch into the post-2.6.15 branch of linux-2.6-block
tree?
Thanks.  :-)
