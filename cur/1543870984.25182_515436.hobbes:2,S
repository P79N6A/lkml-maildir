this may be sad, unless you've spent time and effort to make a Patch,
i.e. read source, understand why it's written so, why it's being used now
that way, and why it has to be updated on new cycle of kernel
development.
> a brief aside on the dominance of x86 from Oleg,
I didn't have a chance, and probably i will not have one, to communicate
with people like you to learn from your wisdom personally. That's why
i've replied to your, after you've mentioned transputers. And i've got
rather different opinion, than i expected. That shows my test-tube
being, little experience etc. As discussion was about CPUs, it was
technical, thus on-topic for LKML.

Offlist message was my share of view about things, that were offtopic,
and clarifying about lkml thing, and it wasn't on-topic for LKML.
I'm pretty sure, that there libraries of books, written on every single
bit of things Linux currently *implements* in asm/C.
(1) Thus, `return -ENOPATCH', man, regardless what you are saying in
lkml. That's why prominent people, you've joined me with (:, replied in
go-to-kernelnewbie style.

You, as a person, who have right to be personally wrong, may think that
way. But do not forget, as i've wrote you offlist and in (1), this is
development community, sometimes development of development one, etc;
educated, enthusiastic, wise, Open Source, poor on time (and money :).

And you too. LKML *can* (sometimes may) show how useful this hacking is.

You are discussing on-topic thing in the P.S. And this is IMHO wrong
approach.
Also, note, that i've changed subject, stripped cc list, please note,
that i can be young and naive boy barking up the wrong tree.
Kind regards.
