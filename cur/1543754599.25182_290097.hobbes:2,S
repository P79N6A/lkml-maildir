Does this mean that we can't mmap the screen regen buffer at
0x000b8000 anymore?
How do I look at the real-mode interrupt table starting at
offset 0? You know that the return value of mmap is to be
checked for MAP_FAILED, not for NULL, don't you?
What 'C' standard do you refer to? Seg-faults on null pointers
have nothing to do with the 'C' standard and everything to
do with the platform.
I don't think you should apply this patch. It puts "your"
policy in the kernel. Now, your policy might be "good" for
you, but the kernel is not supposed to have such policy
inside.
