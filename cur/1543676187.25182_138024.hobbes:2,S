I also can't get networking up on current bk, I don't know if this is
the same problem, the system did not hang (I'm not running NIS?).
I also got that "sender address length == 0" message, I have not seen it
before, it seems to be output by the "ip -o link".
During boot:
[ ... ]
Enabling local filesystem quotas:  [  OK  ]
Enabling swap space:  [  OK  ]
/bin/cat: /proc/ksyms: No such file or directory
INIT: Entering runlevel: 3
Entering non-interactive startup
Setting network parameters:  [  OK  ]
Bringing up interface lo:  [  OK  ] 
sender address length == 0 
sender address length == 0
Starting system logger: [  OK  ]
Starting kernel logger: [  OK  ]
Starting portmapper: [  OK  ]  
Starting NFS file locking services:
[ ... ]
After logging in:
[root@elm3b79 root]# ifup eth0
sender address length == 0
[root@elm3b79 root]# ip -o link
sender address length == 0
[root@elm3b79 root]# dmesg | grep eth0
eth0: Digital DS21140 Tulip rev 33 at 0xf8800000, 00:00:BC:0F:03:EB, IRQ 36.
