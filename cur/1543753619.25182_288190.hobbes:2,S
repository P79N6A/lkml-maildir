I don't think there neeeds to be a special order while loading the 
modules, since each module will provide a defined interface which can be 
registered in a linked list and sorted on demand. Just init all 
compiled-in modules and sort using a kernel-parameter (remembering 
modprobe might be fubar), then modprobe (if compiled-in) all missing 
decision modules from the list (appending them) and resort again.
If the admin wants to add a module later, he can also change the order
again, possibly after configuring the module. Disabeling may be either
done by moving a decision past one without fall-through or by using a
seperate list.
There will be a need for a controling instance which will build a list of
candidates and pass it to each decision module in turn untill the victim
is found. Maybe the list will need a field for a ranking offset and a
scaling factor if a module is not supposed to do the final decision but to
modify the ranking for some blessed processes.

It can, but it should be run from the (possibly autogenerated)  
initr{d,amfs} if it's used.

ACK. (It's just me - for now)
Upgrading kernels used to be a drop-in replacement, except for ISDN and 
(for 2.4 -> 2.6) v4l. I like it that way.
