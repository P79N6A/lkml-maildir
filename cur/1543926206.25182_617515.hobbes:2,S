Patch 1/5 - reworked to fix stupid compile bug
Patch 2/5 - incorporate Eike, Linas, and Willy's comments
Patch 3/5 - no change
Patch 4/5 - was acpi-pci-slot-driver patch, now modifies
	    pci_add_hotplug(). I changed the ordering on this so
	    the tree doesn't break at this point in the series
Patch 5/5 - now is acpi-pci-slot-driver patch, cleaned up
	    implementation so our slot detection is a little
	    better
Thanks.
