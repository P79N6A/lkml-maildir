I still did not have much time to spend on it but booting today I suddenly got
i2c_adapter i2c-0: Unsupported chip (man_id=0x41, chip_id=0x42).
I begin to suspect that it is still lm90 (at least partly). Transacton did not 
fail (otherwise we were not here) but returned some strange value. Anyone 
knows if such chip really exits?
TIA
