The main question is do we declare cap_effective to belong solely to
capability.c, or do we want capability.c to trust previous LSM's
computations of those values?  So, even with the current case, if we
insmod, rmmod, then re-insmod capability, do we want to revoke all
previous cap_* computations?
It seems reasonable for it "belong" to capability.c (and I've heard of
noone else wanting to use it).  I just don't think we've explicitly
declared this to be the case.
