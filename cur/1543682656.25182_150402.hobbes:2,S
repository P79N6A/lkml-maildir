I realized I could do this, and it can of course be automated with an
additional bkcvs specific hack in cvsps. But the tag in every file would
have kept the functionality generic with the already available -r
option, and since I can't see any downside in the tag in the files, I
prefer that generic way.
But if you're sure the tags aren't coming back we can start adding the
automation to cvsps.
thanks,
Andrea
