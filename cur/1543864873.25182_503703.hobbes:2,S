The timekeeping code, and hrt/dynamic tick both wait till after boot up
to switch to high res mode ..
The specific code block you commented on above was added cause acpi_pm
has special pci fixups that don't function properly earlier in boot up.
So it can't be arbitrarily raised to order in the initcall sequence ..
