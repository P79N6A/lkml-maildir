You can't get there from here (at least not very easily).
If you have 60 trees, and want a merge for each one every 2 months, you have to
average 1 tree a day.  How big a delay you want in step (2) directly impacts
how many trees you merge at once - if you want a week of cook time, you have to
merge 7 trees every Monday, and so on...
