yeah, we'll add some description to the patches themselves, but 
otherwise i'm afraid it will be like with almost all patch submissions 
on lkml: 99% of the details are in the code and people have to ask 
specifically if one area or another is unclear :-|
Meanwhile the patch names should provide you with some initial info 
(also, we reuse GTOD which is documented in -mm) and the splitup is 
pretty clean too - but in any case please feel free to ask pointed 
questions! (we happily accept documentation patches as well.)
