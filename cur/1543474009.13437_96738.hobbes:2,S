The easiest way out of this problem is to build a new binary rpm from
the util-linux 2.9 source rpm.
Rpm dependancies reflect what was on the machine when the binary rpm
was built much more than the actual mnimum revisions of other packages
which are needed featurewise. Eg a package could build and work fin
with either libc5 or glibc but if you build a binary rpm on a glibc
system it won't install on a libc5 system.
