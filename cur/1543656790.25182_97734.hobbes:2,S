Linus,
 Please pull from bk://linux-dj.bkbits.net/agpgart to get at the
following fixes..
- AGP 3.0 now compiles as a module too.
- beginnings of VIA KT400 AGP 3.0 support.
  (Not functional yet, more work needed).
- corrected handling of AGP capability bit in PCI headers for chipset drivers.
  This should fix the problems on I815 and similar chipsets.
- small cleanups (making functions static, making things __initdata etc)
- Hopefully fix AMD K8 GART driver
- Fix module exit routine in backend
- Unmark some things __init (The cause of many modules bugs)
- agp_generic_agp_3_0_enable() now returns FALSE to the chipset driver
  if it can't configure in 3.0 mode instead of falling back to
  generic 2.0 routines.
- Export agp_generic_agp_3_0_enable() to work as module.
- Missing HP ZX1/Intel I460 fixes from David Mosberger (My bad)
- Changed I7505 driver to handle new agp_generic_agp_3_0_enable semantics.
- Renamed some VIA chipsets.
