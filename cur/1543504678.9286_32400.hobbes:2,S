IMVHO as a "End User" I was under the impression that MSDOS filesystem
know nothing about long names. In following this thread, I have always
wondered why the VFAT file system didn't just only export the long names
when available. If I wanted to work with the 8+3 filenames then I would
mount the drive as a MSDOS filesystem. No need to muck with the long
names at all, just like DOS 6.22; if you mess with the files, you handle
the consequences (namely that you have lost all long names.)
