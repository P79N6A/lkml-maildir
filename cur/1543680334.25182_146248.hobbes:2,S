That's right. If we have a lot of high-contention locks in the kernel,
we need to fix the code first, to get benefits for the other
architectures. 
"mwait" granularity (64-byte, for example) is given by the cpuid
instruction, and we did not use it because 1) it's unlikely that the
other fields of the task structure are modified when it's idle, 2) the
processor needs to check the flag after mwait anyway, to avoid waking up
with a false signal caused by other break events (i.e. mwait is a hint).
