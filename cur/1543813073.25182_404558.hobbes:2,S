Suggested addition:
  Also make sure you provide useful help text for every entry you add
to Kconfig so that users of your driver will be able to read about
what it does, what hardware it supports and perhaps find a reference
to more extensive documentation.

  Optionally you may also want to add an entry to the CREDITS file.

Perhaps add a bit of text here about integrating patches send to you,
as maintainer of the driver, by random people.
