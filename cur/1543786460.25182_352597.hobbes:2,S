I thought so at first too but was having problems with the call to
eepro_probe1() a bit further down where request_region() is called a second time
and this would have resulted in two consecutive calls to request_region for the
same region without freeing it. I guess in the actual __request_region() in the
while loop, during the second call IORESOURCE_BUSY will be returned meaning that
the region is already reserved?

should I remove it then altogether?
