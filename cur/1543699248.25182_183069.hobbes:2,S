How does sampling free pages give you an accurate measurement of swap
activity?  If I look at the free-page count at one-minute intervals, the
system can, and WILL, inhale and exhale pages at a frightening clip, and
there is no way I can see that sampling free-page count in a
low-overhead way will do the trick.
How does vmstat disk-swap activity?  Looking at the source for vmstat in
procps-2.0.11 I see how they do it for 2.4 kernels, but the part for 2.5
kernels doesn't seem to try to pick up swap statistics at all -- because
there are none to get?
(signed) Puzzled.
(Why does this whole discussion remind me of the Firesign Theatre album
_I Think We're All Bozos On This Bus_, and the question that Ah Clem
asked:  "Why does the porridge-bird lay his eggs in the air?")
