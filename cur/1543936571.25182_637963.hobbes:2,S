thanks, applied.
Sidenote - there were a few checkpatch failures:
 ERROR: use tabs not spaces
 #121: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/aperture_64.c:233:
 +        return 0;$
 ERROR: use tabs not spaces
 #173: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/aperture_64.c:285:
 +                fix = 1;$
i fixed them up. (please run "scripts/checkpatch.pl your.patch" in the 
future.)
