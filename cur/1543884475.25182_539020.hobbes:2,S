Ok. I guess the same is the reason with a few other architectures like 
s390.

Well, ACPI seems to be supporting it.
acpi_processor_hotadd_init() in drivers/acpi/processor_core.c appears 
to be equivalent to pSeries_add_processor(), except that the former
creates the sysfs entries on a hot add, while the later just updates
the cpu_present map.

No, it is not causing any problems :-)
I was just overwhelmed to see cpu0 to cpu77 in the sysfs entries on the
lpar which I was using. Looking at the kernel code, I figured out that
the MAX_CPUS for that lpar was 39 and each virtual cpu was probably
running 2 threads. That explained the 78 sysfs entries.
Thanks for the explaination anyway.
