Subject: [patch] fix .text.exit error in drivers/scsi/ips.c

Hi Jack,
your recent "ServeRAID driver update" patch to Linux 2.4.20-pre removed
the __devexit_p from the pointer to the __devexit function
ips_remove_device and added two other pointers to this function that don't
use __devexit_p. This results in the following compile error when
compiling the driver statically into a kernel without support for
hot-plugging:
<--  snip  -->
...
        --end-group \
        -o vmlinux
drivers/scsi/scsidrv.o(.data+0xc3f4): undefined reference to `local
symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
drivers/scsi/scsidrv.o(.data+0xc434): undefined reference to `local
symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
drivers/scsi/scsidrv.o(.data+0xc474): undefined reference to `local
symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
The fix is simple:
