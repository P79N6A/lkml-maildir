For sure!  You can probably help yourself (and people on the list) by
upgrading your kernel to something a bit newer.  No one still have a box
with such installation, anyway.
Common, your modem is that slow?  Ok, let's say you have a 28.8 KBps...
Should be about 2 hours to download the file; give it a try yourself:
http://internetservices.cnet.com/g/bm/dl/0001.asp?filename=Linux
+Kernel+2.4.
20+(tar.bz2)&sd=26.1MB&size=27421046 .  Of course, make sure to download the
bzip version, not the gzip one (
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.20.tar.bz2
 ).
Once installed, make sure to keep a clean version of the kernel tree, so in
the future you can regularly download incremental updates; kernel's patch
are about 1 MB per development month.
Give it a try, then if it still not works, it could be useful to mention it
on LKML.  But then, be preapared to do testing by yourself, cause it seems
like you're the only one experiencing such problems.

Sorry to say it, but i don't think Linux is a good place for laziness;
actually I know about an operating system developped by lazy programmers for
lazy users...  Don't remember the name ;)
