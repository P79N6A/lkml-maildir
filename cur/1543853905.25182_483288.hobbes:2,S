radeonfb is still using its own code for saving and restoring PCI 
registers; I'm in the process of fixing it up to use proper PCI
subsystem calls.  That will hopefully work better.   
It's possible there's a good reason (other than "nobody's ported it over 
yet") that the radeonfb driver is doing it manually, but I don't know 
why that would be the case.
