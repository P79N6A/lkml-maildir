Damn. Fixed.

So they can be called from the AFS stub. However, the sys_*() versions
shouldn't be there.

There won't be many PAGs. Basically one per login session would be fairly
typical, and possibly one per SUID program run at some later date.

It's not without precedent within the kernel. The compiler is free to inline
it, but must also emit an out-of-line copy. Thinking about it, it's probably
not worth it... these calls aren't going to be called very often and so don't
need to be optimised for every last ounce of speed.

Well, the coding style is wrong here IMNSHO. Readability is preferable.

I'm trying not to cause hyper syscall breeding, but since they are three
separate logical functions, it I'll split it out anyway.
> What protects vfspag->tokens?
Why does it need to be protected at that point? The PAG no longer has any
references, and the tokens don't point back to it, and are in any case pinned
by virtue of being on the list.

Done.

Maybe. But then that's introducing a conditional branch that you can't avoid,
even if you know it's going to succeed:-/

Okay, I've conditionalised it.
