Welcome to the club :-) We're working on fairly similar issues
in the ABISS project,

I can guess :-) Your shopping list looks similar to ours.
I think we've pretty much covered the elevator side. Our proof of
concept elevator does priorities and a number of related things.
This is synchronized with Jens' work, so these features should
eventually show up in CFQ and the block IO layer. (At which point
the ABISS elevator shall be unceremoniously scrapped.)
VM work is lined up next. So far, the most promising approach for
getting rid of VM interference seems to be to base things on the
NUMA infrastructure.
We currently support "real-time" reading from FAT, VFAT, ext2, and
ext3. There are also some scary things we can do for writing, such
as messing with the block allocation strategy (*). The latter are
currently only for FAT and VFAT.
(*) Doing file system brain surgery at this level may be a dead
    end. Just getting the various file systems to support
    reservations or an equivalent way for obtaining large
    contiguous allocations looks like a much nicer approach.
As far as doing unspeakable things with drive manufacturers is
concerned, control over defect management and thermal calibration
come to mind. Zoning and noise management details may also be of
interest.
I'm not sure how deep you really want to go there. I'd expect that
by selecting reasonably well-behaved drives and just measuring
what they do, a useful performance envelope could be determined,
that will allow you to provide adequate buffering and/or
prefetching to cover the occasional drive hickup.
