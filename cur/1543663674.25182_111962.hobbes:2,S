	Thank God, it's not agpgart's fault, it is the fact that Dave Jones mentioned 
earlier, I doubdt that any (ATI, nVidia..) drivers support AGP8x transfer 
rate.
	If this agpgart works fine with 2x and 4x transfer rates, than I believe that 
my backport is correct. We will have to wait drivers that support 8x transfer 
rate, and then test it, or to hack their binaries, but I doubdt that any one 
of us have time to do such a thing.
	The fact that it now sets aperture size correctly for 8x is a good sign :)
