1. The new 2.2.x kernels hang after uncrompressing kernel .. Ok, Booting
Linux probably AIC7xxx
2. I have tried to build both 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 kernels on both my Alpha
and Intel machines. In both situations it hangs after Uncompressing
Kernel ... Ok, Booting Linux. The system is trying to do something on
the harddrive (since I hear it rattle about 2 seconds) and then it
hangs. Both machines have Adaptec 2940 controllers in it. I have
compiled the AIC7xxx driver in the kernel/ Like I always done with the
2.0.xx kernels.
3. Kernel hangs, during boot, probably by AIC7xxx SCSI
4. 2.2.0 and 2.2.1
5. N/A since kernel won't boot
6. N/A since kernel won't boot
7. N/A since kernel won't boot
