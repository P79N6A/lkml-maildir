Subject: [2.6 patch] IA64_GENERIC shouldn't select other stuff

IA64_GENERIC shouldn't select other stuff.
select'ing ACPI without select'ing PCI had broken ACPI in the past (the 
current workaround is that ACPI select's PCI).
Select'ing NUMA means that the illegal configuration NUMA=y, FLATMEM=y 
is possible.
The generic setting might be required in some places, but select'ing 
some options like NUMA while not select'ing some other similar 
important options like PCI doesn't make much sense.
