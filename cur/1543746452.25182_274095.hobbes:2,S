Being waaaaaay to busy at work to care about MCA-related things anymore,
combined with the fact that I didn't bring along any of my old
MCA-machines when I moved the last time, I've asked James Bottomley to
take over the MCA maintainership.
I don't have anything to object against these patches, but I'm not able
to test them...
