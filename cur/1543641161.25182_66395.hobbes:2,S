Thanks for your input. I've checked the tests you ran on my kernel patch -ck3 
and found that the kernel config was set at default which means preemptible and 
low latency were disabled. I dont see a way of changing the kernel config, and 
I need these enabled in the tests otherwise the tests are not useful. 
Suggestions?
