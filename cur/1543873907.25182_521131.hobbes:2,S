Isn't RSDL fair to each task? So each of the 101 tasks (1 and 2) gets an equal 
share... That doesn't sound unfair to me. if the current scheduler manages to 
give the single task 10 times more cpu to task one, that wouldn't be fair. 
Unless you want to be fair to a single process, no matter how many threads.

I don't see RSDL having heuristics here - it just gives each task an equal 
share of CPU. The single task gets 1/101th of cpu, equal to all others...

I guess I just don't get it, would the current kernel give 50% cpu to the 
single thread, and 0,5% to each of the 100 other threads?!? How would it do 
that? Does it schedule a process with several threads equal to a process 
having 1 thread, so each gets an equal share of cpu?
