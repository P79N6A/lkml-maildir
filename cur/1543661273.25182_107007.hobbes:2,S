This can be explained.  When the pnpbios makes a get current resource call
on a buggy system it causes a GPF.  In 2.5.59 I designed the pnpbios driver
to avoid making this call when scanning for devices.  It uses a get boot
resource call instead.
In other words...
Without this patch, if you made the following change it would panic.
 		 * from devices that are can only be static such as
 		 * those controlled by the "system" driver.
 		 */
-		if (pnp_bios_get_dev_node(&nodenum, (char )1, node))
+		if (pnp_bios_get_dev_node(&nodenum, (char )0, node))
 			break;
 		nodes_got++;
 		dev =  pnpbios_kmalloc(sizeof (struct pnp_dev), GFP_KERNEL);
1 = boot config
0 = current config
Therefore it can be concluded that this patch does indeed solve the problem
for your system :-).

Thank you for testing my patch.
