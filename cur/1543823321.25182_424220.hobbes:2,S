here's the kern log for the last 24 hours or so:

As I told Jeff, I'm not sure how to diddle with the irq stuff, pointers?

Sorry, I haven't owned a copy of Windows in >5 yrs, I would be willing
to try otherwise. This computer worked with a 2 160gb sata drives,
when I traded 2 160gb drives with 2 500gb sata2 drives and started
making heavy use of them this happened, although I haven't had any
issue with the other hard drive yet (I don't think, I need to look
over the logs again to make sure I'm not saying that in err).
