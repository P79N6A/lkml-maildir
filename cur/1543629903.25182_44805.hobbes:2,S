Not quite yet.  I considered moving the functionality of /proc/bus/pci
into driverfs, but couldn't find a good solid reason to do it (and it
would involve changing lspci and any other userspace programs that use
it today.)
Now reimplementing /proc/bus/pci as a stand alone filesystem mounted in
that position (like usbfs is) is another story.  pcifs anyone?  :)
