Elaborating on Ingo's "one mechanism" comments, I believe a marker
widget needs to be generic at run time.  We're not just looking for a
way of hiding direct calls to lttng in a marker macro.  We're looking
for a way of marking spots & data in a uniform way, then later
(run-time) binding each of those markers to (tools such as) lttng
and/or systemtap.
