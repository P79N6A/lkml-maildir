They are not naive, just young, and the young don't know what they
cannot do yet, and this gives them the ability to achive the impossible
at times -- don't fault them for that.
I have no axe to grind, but I do have a different view.  I'm the 1 in 30
million men born with an extra Y chromosone (a double YY), so you are
pertially right there.  DOuble YY males have a different brain structure
-- the lymbic system in my brain is so electrically active, it qualifies
as a third brain.  Normal humans have two brains, left and right.  Like
most double YY's I have three, left, right, lymbic.  Fortunately for me,
my frontal lobes are normal and do not exhibit the wiring problems that
afflict 60% of double YY's, such as an uncontrollable urge to take an
axe and chop someone to pieces because they pissed me off.  
Famous double YY's of history:
Good:
Nikolov Tesla
Thomas Edison
Albert Einstein
Nostradomos     (DNA analysis of remains in his grave)
Bad:
Charlse Manson
Jack the Ripper  (DNA analysis of 1800's evidence)
Ted Bundy
Jeffrey Dahmer
My view is different, not skewed...
:-)
