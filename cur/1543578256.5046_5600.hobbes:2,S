O - K then.  Nice sig.  Too bad that it is at least as big as
most spam mailings themselves.  Instead of preventing spam,
all you're doing is contributing to it.
I just delete spam now as it is easiest most of the time.
However fortunately, the below sig comes from a static and easily
procmailable address.
One more note is that no law of California, nor anywhre else
means jack shit 50 meters away from your keyboard, so it is all
just a waste of bandwidth.
