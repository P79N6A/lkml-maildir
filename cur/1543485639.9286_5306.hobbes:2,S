So? If B runs waking_non_zero (called by __down_interruptible()) at the
time sem->waking is 0, it will go to sleep in schedule() and will do
nothing.
If insted __down_interruptible() will se a signal pending it will simply
undo the decl() done inside __inline__ down(). 
Can you explain better your point?
