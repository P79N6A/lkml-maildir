With my ide driver and the md stuff all built into the kernel, my software 
raid drives and associated /dev/md? devices are detected and created by the 
kernel.
With the md stuff built in but the ide driver modular and loaded later by 
udev, the drives are not detected.
So, I guessed that perhaps if I made the md stuff modular aswell and load it 
_after_ loading the ide driver, this might kickstart the auto-detect stuff. 
But it didn't :(
Is there a way to make auto-detection work without having the ide driver built 
in?
TIA
