Yes, but not recent.  I did lots of journaling-fs testing and
workloads on 2.4.19-pre7 for LinuxWorld Aug. 2004.
Presentation is here:
  
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/journal_fs/lwe-jgfs.pdf
Simplified summary:
XFS fared well on (large) sequential IO workloads.
And of course, none of the journaling fs-es beat ext2, but
XFS came the closest.
At the time of that presentation, JFS was very slow.  The JFS team
was working on correctness/robustness only, not performance.
I don't know the status of that today.
It's somewhat of a shame, because on paper JFS looks like a great
filesystem (IMO).
