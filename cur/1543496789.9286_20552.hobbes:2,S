There isn't one per se.  Closest thing to a CLI is the debugger or MacsBug
(if it's installed).

MacsBug, if installed, dumps you to a CLI-ish thing--when it detects and can
trap a crash--where you can play with all sorts of debugging info (much like
what I hear SysRq does under Linux, if I'm even close to being correct....)
and attempt to find out why you crashed.
The regular old ROM-based debugger is far less robust (read:  practically
useless), so most people who want or need a debugger use MacsBug.

Not quite.  They have their File Type and Creator ID in them.  These are two
two-byte hex values (stored in the Resource Fork) that tell what sort of
file it is and what application created it in addition to telling the Finder
and other applications what icon to show if the custom icon bit in the
Resource Fork isn't set.  This gets checked against the Desktop Database
(which is kind of like the Windows 9x/NT Registry, except it keeps better
track of where applications and files-that-are-referenced-by-aliases have
gotten to) which opens up the proper application, or, if the application
that created it can't be found, it checks the File Exchange database for a
listing of Applications that *can* open the file and allows the user to
choose from these.

Who in his right mind would use MacPaint anymore?  :)
This was probably a bit off-topic, but I thought I'd help to enlighten
people as to how things are done on other platforms.
