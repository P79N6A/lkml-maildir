Oh, it can be.  I wasn't going to require something from all archs for
this one case (well, it was more like zero cases when I first did the
patch).

Sure... or just make all archs supply a "cpus_online_of(mask)" which
does that, unless there are other interesting cases.  Or we can go the
other way and have a general "and_region(void *res, void *a, void *b,
int len)".  Which one do you want?

Spinning 1000 times doesn't phase me until someone complains.
Breaking userspace code does.  One can be fixed if it proves to be a
bottleneck.  Understand?
