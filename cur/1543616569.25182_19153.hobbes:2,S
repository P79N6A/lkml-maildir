It is, but there was a bug in the PPC machine description in 3.0.x
(x=0,1), or something. It's supposedly fixed in later gcc's.
Tom, which gcc version do you have? I thought the fix made it into 3.0.3
(and from other issues I suspect it's better to upgrade to that anyway for
kernel compilation).
Or is this some other problem (ie if you see this on non-ppc compilation,
holler, and we'll try to see what's up)
