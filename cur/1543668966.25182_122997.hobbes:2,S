I just tried with APM; machine powers down without problems. It's ACPI which
doesn't power down. Last thing it prints during powerdown is:
hwsleep-0178 [-24] Acpi_enter_sleep_state: Entering S5
I can't find any specific A7V workarounds in 2.5.66 ACPI code, so I guess
the ACPI code in 2.4 isn't up-to-date.
The original poster's problem is then probably indeed related to a buggy BIOS
if it doesn't even powerdown with APM.
