memmap takes multiple arguments, including the start address for the
memory map. You could also bump min_low_pfn manually if memmap= isn't
suitable for you, something like:
	magic_space = PFN_UP(init_pg_tables_end);
	min_low_pfn = magic_space + magic_size;
(assuming magic_size is rounded up already), should work fine. Though
memmap= already takes care of most of this for you, could you explain why
it's unsuitable?
