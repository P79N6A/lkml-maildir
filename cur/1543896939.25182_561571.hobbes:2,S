Typing "Linux XScale 270 or 27x" brings you a lot of pages but not an 
in depth doc/HOWTO how to compile your own kernel and make a boot 
image for that arch. The vendor from which I get the XScale sponsored 
has ready to use Linux images and source on his webpage, but they're 
kinda old and dusty.

So what are the steps I've to take, to get a Linux Kernel on a XScale? 
It's obvious that I need a cross compiler for ARM, bootloader images 
and so on, but it's the gory details I'm curios about.
Links to HOWTOs, documentation highly appreciated. And probably 
there's also a better suited maillist than LKML for this, to a 
pointer to that (if existing) would be nice, too.
Thanks in advance
Wolfgang
