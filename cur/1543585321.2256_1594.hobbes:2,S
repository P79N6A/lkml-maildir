How is the performance difference ?

Free memory is wasted memory.   It seemed like 2.4 wasted a lot less memory
than 2.2 on your workload.
Could you do some performance measurements (eg. average latency on IMAP
connection or something like that)   ?    It would be great to know wheter
2.4 is better or worse than 2.2  (it's most likely better, since it probably
uses the memory better, but it would be nice to know)
