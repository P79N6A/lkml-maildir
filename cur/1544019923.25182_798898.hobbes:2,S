Hello Russell,
this E-mail responds to your comments on patches C 04 through C 08.  
My understanding is that you'd like me to:
1. Compress patches C 04 through C 09;
2. Modify omap3_noncore_dpll_enable() to move the "if (!ret)
   clk->rate = rate" outside and below the conditional;
3. Remove some of the blank lines before and after braces in C 06;
4. Modify the DPLL bypass clock handling to change the DPLL's clk->parent,
   rather than return the bypass clock rate.
The above all make sense to me, and #4, if it works in practice, should be 
a significant improvement over the existing code.
If this is what you're looking for, I'll send a compressed, modified 
patch.  Would you like it to be based on the codebase post C 03, or 
against another commit?
regards,
- Paul
