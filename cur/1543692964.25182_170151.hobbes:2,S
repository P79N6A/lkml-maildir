I don't know much about kernel internals but of the 2.5 and 2.6 kernels I
have tried, 2.6.0-test6 is by far the best on the desktop for my use (xmms,
vmware, firebird, loads of other apps). With this patch it's better still.
Before patching simple things like ls or ps have an annoying slowness while
under a moderate/heavy load. For the most part things are fine but after
patching commands respond more quickly. This is the first time for me a
2.5+ kernel has been responsive enough to use on a daily basis.
Thanks everyone for the great work!
