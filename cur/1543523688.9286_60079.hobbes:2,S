there seems to be a widespread problem with resolving kernel.org names.
in particular, "host -a linux.kernel.org" normally shows me
linux.kernel.org        172800 IN       A       206.184.214.34
which is incorrect, and should be:
linux.kernel.org        3600 IN A       209.10.217.83
which you can get by explicitly querying ns[12].{kernel.org,transmeta.com}.
from looking at the various records, I don't see where the 172800 second TTL
is coming from, or its stale IP.  I reported this on the 13 to HPA...
regards, mark hahn.
