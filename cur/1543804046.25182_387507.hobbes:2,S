Ah yes, Jeff hadn't previously merged the small version of that change.
Indeed description is a little incorrect.

It simply how suffling the code re-ordered it. I don't think its a
problem but if anyone has a problem I can go and re-re-order it.
libata also really should do adev->pio_mode = XFER_PIO_0; ->set_piomode
before doing its initial identify etc because there is no guarantee the
BIOS didn't leave the hardware in a bogus state.

Apparently not.
