   A lot of these issues should be fixed in test8-pre2. It does more of a
   true job of having shared signals instead of emulating them with a global
   "blocked" list and spreading them out to be local signals.
I looked at test8-pre2, and the basic strategy looks promising :-).
However folding CLONE_SIGHAND and CLONE_THREAD onto CLONE_SIGNAL
doesn't work.  The current LinuxThreads library uses CLONE_SIGHAND but
cannot deal with the thread group stuff (it relies on getpid()
returning the process ID of the thread and not the process ID of the
thread-group leader).  Basically locks up every existing
multi-threaded program.
