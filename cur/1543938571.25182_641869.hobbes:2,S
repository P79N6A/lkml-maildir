Was this with the revert Mel mentioned applied as well? I get the
feeling both patches are needed to fix up the memoryless SLAB issue.

I might be barking up the wrong tree, but this block above is supposed
to set up the cachep->nodeslists[*] that are used immediately below.
But if the loop wasn't changed from N_NORMAL_MEMORY to N_ONLINE or
whatever, you might get a bad access right below for node 0 that has
no memory, if that's the node we're running on...
