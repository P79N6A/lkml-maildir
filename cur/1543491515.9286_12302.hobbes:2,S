I have something strange that I only noticed since switching to
2.2.5 and configuring the kernel for firewalling and masquerading...
Now it seems that I get "double" routes on the box...
simply doing:
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
automatically sets up
192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
in the routing tables.  (which is pretty neat.)
But it isn't automatically setting up routes for the lo interface.
however, RedHat comes along and the /etc/rc.d/init.d/network script(s)
causes calls to /sbin/route for every interface enabled (and this is where
127.0.0.0 gets setup too but without duplicates routes because of the above.)
So the end result is this weirdness...
[root@server /etc]# route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
10.0.0.0        *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
10.0.0.0        *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
127.0.0.0       *               255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
Which I don't know how to correct other than sticking a couple of calls
in rc.local to "down" and then "up" eth0 and eth1.
Anybody have a clue what I've messed up?
