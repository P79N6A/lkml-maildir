Subject: O(1) issue - new processes should start with interrupts disabled?

About a year ago I was working on a MIPS 2.4 kernel with O(1) and hit
the following bug.  See the back trace below.  The interrupt that triggered
do_IRQ() happened exactly after switch_to() (switching to a newly forked 
process) but before the new process calls schedule_tail().
As a result try_to_take_up() goes into infinite loop because it can't
grap this_rq()->lock as it is already locked at the beginning of schedule().
The fix was trivial.  I simply turned off interrupt for newly forked processes.
Interrupts are turned on again during schedule_tail() call, which seems to be
the right place.
Right now I am trying to get this issue straighten out in 2.6 tree.  I am curious 
why this bug does not show on other architectures?  Because switch_to() does 
not change the interrupt status of CPU on other arches?
