Because to convert the existing ISDN4Linux heap into the new APIs would
require someone with all the cards involved and a lot of time (as the
card drivers need a *lot* of work by now to bring them up to todays work)

Of course not - and I4L as originally merged is very different to I4L as
it is now - both because it was maintained and because other people fixed
things when it was easy to do so (eg the tty layer changes).

"Precedent", that implies it is a new behaviour - which it isn't. We
regularly break old driver code when it is neccessary in order to make
general progress. Grep for "BROKEN" in the kernel tree.

If the changes to make it use pci_get_ were trivial I'd simply have
pushed them, but they are not due to the rather bizarre structure of some
of the drivers - ditto some of the other changes.
You, and anyone else who wants to, are free to work on I4L and fix it,
improve it and make it better.
