My monitor (Iiyama Vision Master Pro 21) turns its power off as soon
as it realizes that the screen was staying black for a certain amount
of time (configurable). It hasn't anything to do with power management
stuff, since I can also reproduce it by turning the cursor off and
then typing "clear; sleep 10000000" in my shell.
That's why I appreciate the kernel console blanking.
Although I suppose it would do the same if you just cycle the colors,
since the monitor shouldn't notice the difference. But you would have
to cycle the colors to black, I guess. "very dark grey" would probably
not be enough.
And then I see no point in cycling the colors instead of blanking.
