I perfectly understand that, what I do object against, is rejecting a
concept (like this) totally because the developers(?) do not like the
mechanism that's used (although ACPI is used everywhere else in the
kernel). At least there might be some discussion where this sort of code
belongs to make the design clean and easily maintainable, instead of
instantly completely rejecting the concept, because OP simply doesn't
like acpi.
