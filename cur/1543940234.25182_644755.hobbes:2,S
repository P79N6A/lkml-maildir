I still think your solution is good but even with the original patch we do 
not call try_to_release_page() with GFP_KERNEL under rcu.
   if (PageAnon(page)) {
                rcu_read_lock();
                rcu_locked = 1;
        }
rcu is only active if we have an anonymous page and in that case we do not
call try_to_release_page(). Just to make sure that Nick and I do not get 
dinged needlessly....
