Particular case is combination of my screwup, seriously convoluted code
in original and Oleg not sending the fix we'd settled down upon to Linus
(as far as I can tell).
Broken patches _are_ bad and "how many FS are there" is a BS argument.
It _is_ possible to do that right and when it's done wrong - it's a
fuckup of patch author, period.
Proposal is a bit naive, though - in most of the cases fuckups merrily
pass original testing.
