I know this doesn't happen very often but:-
If the BIOS (or Boot ROM) leaves the screen not in the normal 80x25 text
mode (in my case the screen was in 80x50 mode) then when the kernel boots it
thinks the screen only has 25 lines so will scroll at line 25 rather than
50.  The console is then totally messed up and no amount of setfont will
rectify the situation.  With the first few lines displaying not in the
viewable screen area and ncurses programs complaining about invalid
coordinates.
Perhaps it would be good if the kernel specifically sets the screen mode
into a known state before booting.
Just a thought for you all.
