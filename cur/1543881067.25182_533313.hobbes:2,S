Hi;
USRobotics Wireless Adapter (Model 5423) works well with current zd1211rw 
driver also (i have tested 2.6.18, 2.6.20 and 2.6.21-rc7). I know -mm/and 
Daniel's tree has new version (i think with more features like rate estimator 
etc.) of this driver but maybe you should consider that one as a .21 material 
instead of waiting full wireless-dev merge? 
I'm not sure "Signed-off-by" cause -mm one already has that id but in case of 
need, here it is.
