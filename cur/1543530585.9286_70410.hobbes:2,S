Subject: errors when making 2.3.99-pre1 and up

When ever I type make anything in the the new kernel directory I get these 
messages repeatedly throught-out the make:
/bin/sh: invalid character 45 in exportstr for DRIVERS-y
/bin/sh: invalid character 45 in exportstr for DRIVERS-
/bin/sh: invalid character 45 in exportstr for DRIVERS-m
/bin/sh: invalid character 45 in exportstr for DRIVERS-n
This happens in make mrproper, and menuconfig, etc.  I think it must be the - 
character.  I am using Debian unstable (woody).
