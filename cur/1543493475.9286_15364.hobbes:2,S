Hi
I have a DawiControl SCSI card and ever since I upgraded my system to
kernel 2.2.x and modutils 2.1.121 (I think) My SCSI card has been
playing up. Regularly resetting my SCSI chain if I attempt to do
any sort of sustained access, e.g. dd'ing an image off CD, or writing
a CD in my Yamaha 4416 CDRW.
Mid-late march, someone told me of a patch which would help me bring my
driver version to 3.2 but two problems arose.
1. I can't find the driver patch
2. It is for 2.2.4 and pre-2.2.5. I am currently on a 2.2.6 vanilla
kernel
The filename I was told to download was
 patch-53c8xx-s01-d00-2.2.3
1. does anyone know if there is a more up to date version
2. does anyone know where I can download it from?
I would appreciate replies to be either direct to me, or CC'ed to me, as
I find it difficult to check the entire list regularly due to college
constraints
Many thanks
Daniel Silverstone
