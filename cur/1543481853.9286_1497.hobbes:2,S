On 32Mb 2.2.0pre9 works ok but not well [1] - I can build a kernel without
much swapping while doing other stuff, on 2.1.132 I can build two
kernels in parallel with the same kind of feel while 2.2.0x chokes up
horribly at this point.
[1] It still beats 2.0.x I should point out 8)
On 8Mb 2.2.0pre6, pre8, pre9 are basically unusable while 2.1.132 was fine
