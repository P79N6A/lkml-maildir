No, I'm wrong, and have been all along in thinking set_page_dirty_lock
could be done better avoiding the lock_page.  inode_lock gives the hint:
it's not irq safe, nor is mapping->private_lock, and both may be taken
by set_page_dirty.  The lock_page in set_page_dirty_lock was the obvious
reason it couldn't be used at interrupt time, but not the only reason.
So your lock_page_nosync does look the best way forward to me now.
