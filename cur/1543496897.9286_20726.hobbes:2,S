Subject: more lilo problems with RH6.0

Hello group,
Currently running RH6.0 and kernel 2.2.5-15.
   I would think that some others are having this trouble too.
I still have kernel versions 2.2.6, 2.2.8 and had just installed 2.3.2. 
I was running 2.3.2 before upgrading from RH5.2 to 6.0 and 2.2.5-15. 
Now, only 2.2.5-15 is listed in lilo.conf, and the entire system is
running fine. Great! Have been trying to install 2.3.2 and lilo keeps
saying that the kernel is too big.
   Just for kicks I tried to resurrect 2.2.8 by just modifying lilo.conf
and re-runing lilo... hmmmmmm.... kernel too big. WTF!  I did *NOT*
recompile the kernel.
   Anyone have similar problem?
