Subject: [PATCH 4/9] uml: fix spinlock recursion and sleep-inside-spinlock in error path
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
In this error path, when the interface has had a problem, we call dev_close(),
which is disallowed for two reasons:
*) takes again the UML internal spinlock, inside the ->stop method of this
   device
*) can be called in process context only, while we're in interrupt context.
I've also thought that calling dev_close() may be a wrong policy to follow, but
it's not up to me to decide that.
However, we may end up with multiple dev_close() queued on the same device.
But the initial test for (dev->flags & IFF_UP) makes this harmless, though -
and dev_close() is supposed to care about races with itself. So there's no harm
in delaying the shutdown, IMHO.
Something to mark the interface as "going to shutdown" would be appreciated, but
dev_deactivate has the same problems as dev_close(), so we can't use it either.
