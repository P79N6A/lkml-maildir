Subject: make-3.79.1 bug breaks linux-2.5.24/drivers/net/hamradio/soundmodem

	linux-2.5.24/drivers/net/hamradio/soundmodem/Makefile contains
the following rule:
$(obj)/sm_tbl_%: $(obj)/gentbl
        $<
	obj was set to "." /usr/src/linux/Rules.make, which was included
earlier in the Makefile.
	The problem is that when make executes this rule it executes
"gentbl" rather than "./gentbl".  This causes the command to fail if
you do not have "." in your path.  Make-3.79.1 is apparently being too
clever in expanding file names.  I think this is a make bug.
	Until the make bug is fixed, I have worked around the problem
by replacing the rule with:
$(obj)/sm_tbl_%: $(obj)/gentbl
        PATH=$(obj):$$PATH $<
