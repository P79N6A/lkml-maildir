And, Ted, THAT is brown steaming matter coming from the south end of a
fertile male bovine. Who is going to have the money to beat MS at the "I
have more attornies than you" game? And what constitutes copying in this
sort of instance? It would be an expensive lawsuit. I suspect that barring
some obvious screwup somewhere MS is immune to worrying its overgrown
head about GPL issues.
