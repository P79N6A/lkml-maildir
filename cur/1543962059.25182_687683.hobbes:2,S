linux-next is _supposed_ to be solely the stuff that is ready to be sent 
to you upon window-open.
The only thing that isn't reliable are the commit ids -- and that's at 
the request of a large majority of maintainers, who noted to Stephen R 
that the branch he was pulling from them might get rebased -- thus 
necessitating the daily tree regeneration.
So, I think a 'next' branch from you would open cans o worms:
- one more tree to test, and judging from linux-next and -mm it's tough 
to get developers to test more than just upstream
- is the value of holy penguin pee great enough to overcome this 
another-tree-to-test obstacle?
- opens all the debates about running parallel branches, such as, would 
it be better to /branch/ for 2.6.X-rc, and then keep going full steam on 
the trunk?  After all, the primary logic behind 2.6.X-rc is to only take 
bug fixes, theoretically focusing developers more on that task.  But now 
we are slowly undoing that logic, or at least openly admitting that has 
been the reality all along.
