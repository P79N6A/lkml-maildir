Without 'volatile' and disabling optimizations altogether, how do we
prevent gcc from optimizing away pointers? As can be seen on
http://wiki.rubygarden.org/Ruby/page/show/GCAndExtensions
 (at
'Compiler over-optimisations and "volatile"'), volatile is used to
prevent a specific type of optimization. This is because of the
garbage collector, which scans the stack and registers to find
referenced objects. So you don't want local variables containing
references to objects optimized away.
While it is again a side-effect of volatile which is being (mis)used,
it is sometimes the only (easy & known) way to achieve this intented
effect...
