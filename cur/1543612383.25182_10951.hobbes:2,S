Does anyone know what the file descriptor 'fd' pointer does?  My module makes 
a system call [sys_open] to the kernal which then returns a fd value but I 
don't know what this value means or how it gets it.  Does the fd value 
signify a specific device or is it random?  Any ideas?
Thanks for your help in advance.
