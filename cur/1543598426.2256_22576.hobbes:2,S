I was just experimenting.  512MB is more than sufficient for my needs, I
just couldn't bypass the $130 (at the time) for the memory which took me to
512MB.
I've seen some later updates to the VM, but at the moment, the 2.4.8 kernel
is working well for me.  Better than the 2.4.6 kernel.

As long as you don't have problems where you can't run your program
multiple times in a row, 2.4 sounds like is is behaving correctly and
sanely.

Are you saying something is wrong?

This is not a requirement but is a requirement to have swap > mem if
you are swapping heavily and want good performance.
