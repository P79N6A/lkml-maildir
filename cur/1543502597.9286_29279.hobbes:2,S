Looks like you completely misunderstood WHO, WHY and HOW asked this question :-))
You was NOT asked "do you think is this feature is nice ?". Not at all. You was
asked: "Are there REALLY strong reasons to keep it in kernel ? Otherwise it will
be shoot in sight RSN". And it was asked by one of "FS guru". One of the guys
who are tired try to support FAT with this ugly mount option in workable state.
So if want to have this mount option in the future you need some strong
arguments and just fact that it can be turned off... And fast...
