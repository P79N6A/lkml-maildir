Today that is Linus + DaveM + others concentrating on the experimental
release, plus Alan Cox and a few others working on the stable one.

OK, give us a copy of Linus and the head hackers, and they take over the
other branch.

It is not double work, the differences are small(ish) today. If wild
development goes on on two branches, crossporting will be very dificult and
they will diverge.
