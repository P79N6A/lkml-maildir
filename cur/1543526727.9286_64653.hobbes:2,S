Currently linux is being ported to more and more
platforms.  Would it be prudent to separate the
arch directory or the include/asm* directories
into 16bit, 32bit,64bit, this could allow more
optimizations for better processors, and maybe
this could be defined somewhere in the configuration
of the kernel.
A setup like this also may help developers such as
the ELKS or anyone who might think of trying linux
on a beefed up C128 :)
