I'm writing a program in which I set up several /proc files.  The output of
these files have to be passed from a user space daemon.  Can someone point to
some code that will give me some clues.  I already have the /proc files set
up, now I need to know how to alert the user space daemon at the point of a
read request, and how to redirect a text stream from the daemon through the
/proc file. --
Thanks,
