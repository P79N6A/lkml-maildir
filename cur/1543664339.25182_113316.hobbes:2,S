hi,
I am trying to make uClinux support the atapi
protocol. But everytime I compile it i'm getting the
following errors (see attachement). I already
rebuilded my toolchain and applied the following patch
http://www.uclinux.org/ports/coldfire/gcc-2.95.3-m68k-zext.patch
and got a little further. Do you know what possibly
goes wrong?? any tips or advice will be deeply welkom.
yours truly and hoping for a reply
a learing student
