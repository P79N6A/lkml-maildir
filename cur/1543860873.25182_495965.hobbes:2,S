Well I call it from two different places but the code is not in the kernel 
(yet)...  Also the way Andrew has added this to -mm it does not use the 
extra space as you say because he added the export as per my patch but 
then removed the export for invalidate_inode_pages() and turned that into 
a static inline instead.
Best regards,
