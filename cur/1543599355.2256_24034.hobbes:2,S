Hello,
the error message is like this:
scsi0:0:3:0: Attempting to queue an ABORT message
scsi0:0:3:0: Cmd aborted from QINFIFO
aic7xxx_abort returns 8194
scsi0:0:3:0: Attempting to queue an ABORT message

aic7xxx_abort returns 8195
lots of these messages. the same happens on scsi0:0:4:0, scsi0:0:5:0 and
scsi0:0:9:0, then I get ext2 and I/O errors. I have 4 of these machines
(ibm netfinity 5100), running for several weeks now as http proxies, and
sometimes they crash (3 from 4 have crashed so far at least once, this is
the first time I have logs from the beginning of the crash). The kernel is
stock 2.4.7. On another machine (netfinity 7100, aic7896) I couldn't boot
stock 2.4.9 because I got these messages right after the boot, the old aic
driver worked though. I'm puzzled because the 5100's worked perfectly for
almost a month. What should I try?
