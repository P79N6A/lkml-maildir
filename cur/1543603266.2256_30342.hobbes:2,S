Afaik, speed is not really an issue (it's not like you're going to
notice a difference anyway, even if you had a struct with 100 different
adapters in it.) As for reapproaching the size of the current
implementation, the difference is that you get one single function that
you don't have to change. You just add one single line to the struct
for each adapter.
Clean design is a virtue ;-)

It's your call.
