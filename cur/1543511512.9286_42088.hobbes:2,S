Um, if the "predictable IP ID's" under discussion is the "TESO SEcurity
Advisonary" talking about the Linux Kernel 2.2.x ISN Vulernerability,
this is fixed already in the latest pre-2.2 kernel issued by Alan (I
believe; Alan, you did get this both into the ac kernels and the pre-2.2
kernel seriesl, right?)  The problem is that the secret used in
secure_tcp_sequence_number isn't getting initialized correctly, due to a
type problem in get_random_bytes().  We should try the simple fix before
we start talking about extreme measures such as installing AVL trees.  :-)
To the Teso crew, if you could try redoing your analysis with the
following patch applied, I would greatly appreciate it.  The problem is
that the secret[] isn't array isn't getting properly initialized, and
the crypto hash doesn't work well when the secret is all zero's.  Chalk
this up to another example of "why C is inherently an unsafe programming
langauge".  (blush)
	if (!rekey_time || (tv.tv_sec - rekey_time) > REKEY_INTERVAL) {
		rekey_time = tv.tv_sec;
		/* First three words are overwritten below. */
-		get_random_bytes(&secret+3, sizeof(secret)-12);
+		get_random_bytes(&secret[3], sizeof(secret)-12);
		count = (tv.tv_sec/REKEY_INTERVAL) << HASH_BITS;
	}
