Another option might be to use a pre allocate pool size based on the number of 
CPUs.  This does not require CPU*n elements as it is is a tree and "n" here is 
worst case so something like "n+#CPUs" elements would be enough.  (n, by the 
way, is the maximum number of levels in the tree).  Its a bit sloppy but, IMHO, 
would survive almost all storms.
