hmhm, I see.

Yeah.
FWIW, we don't need VM_NORESERVE checking now because VM_NORESERVE and VM_ACCOUNT
are exclusive condition now :)

HAHAHA, Indeed.
when hugepage shared read-only mapping  -> hugepage shared writable maping,
following code seems to cause calling vm_enough_memory() although hugepage.
========================================================
mprotect_fixup(struct vm_area_struct *vma, struct vm_area_struct **pprev,
        unsigned long start, unsigned long end, unsigned long newflags)
{
        if (newflags & VM_WRITE) {
                if (!(oldflags & (VM_ACCOUNT|VM_WRITE|
                                                VM_SHARED|VM_NORESERVE))) {
                        charged = nrpages;
                        if (security_vm_enough_memory(charged))
                                return -ENOMEM;
                        newflags |= VM_ACCOUNT;
                }
        }

mel, what do you think this?
