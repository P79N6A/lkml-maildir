Because -git8 is where the firmware requirement got added.
If you build the TG3 driver statically into your kernel,
the only way to get the firmware properly loaded is to
enable that CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL option.
Your filesystem isn't mounted when the driver initializes
in that case, therefore there is no way to get at the
firwware that might be present there.
