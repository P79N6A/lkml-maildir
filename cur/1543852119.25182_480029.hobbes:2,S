Yeah, "unless". But the kernel should be considered fuzzy logic in 
this area :) after all, it does not even need a kernel developer -- a 
binutils contributor might also change something that results in a 
change of link order.
  On the other side, you can run udev _once_ to create device nodes like 
/dev/disk/by-label/ to allow at least correct booting (possibly using 
LABEL=) Once the box is up, one can always figure out which drive is 
which by looking at fdisk or other info. (Gets a little hard when 
they're all the same manufacturer and type, but then again, LABEL= 
will work without udev in the "normal" userspace.)
