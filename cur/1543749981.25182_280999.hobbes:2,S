This looks fishy - this is GFP_ATOMIC | GFP_DMA, where it should only be
GFP_ATOMIC. gdth should not have shost->cmd_pool->gfp_mask ==
GFP_ATOMIC, that looks like a bug in the driver.
Apart from that, the trace looks sane and the SCSI mid layer should
recover from this condition and not cause a hung io subsystem. The only
way I can see this fail is if the scsi host free_list is not filled for
some reason during init, or if the commands allocated from there are
lost or never finished by the hardware.
