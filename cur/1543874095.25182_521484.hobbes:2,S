That would completely and uttly suck if it were the case.
So in theory, the card should be talking at full speed, but since the
bridge is 66 then it would be the bottleneck right?
There are 3 pci busses in the server I am working on, so I know there is
at least _a_ bridge there.....

Both, the e1000 driver asks the card what it sees from it's side of the
connection, and lspci tells you what the cpu side of it is connected to.
Since stuff like pci bridges exist, both could very well be correct!
I highly suspect that that is exactly the case.
