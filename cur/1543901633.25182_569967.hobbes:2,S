Could you reproduce this oops at will at the "bad" points? [ Note that
git-bisect isn't quite applicable to bugs that are not 100% reproducible.
The ones that passed as "good" may have passed only because the
bug didn't get triggered on that particular test. Also, a perfectly good
commit could get unnecessarily marked "bad" because the bug
happened to get triggered for it ... so it's not quite trust-worthy for
your case. ]

Hmm, I don't see why this one could introduce an oops in SLUB,
but it's doing some locking-related stuff, and if it didn't get it right,
the resulting races /could/ lead to some oops. But ... a recently
posted patch (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/16/204
) from Akinobu
Mita does point to an oops that was introduced by commit
0c096b507f15397da890051ee73de4266d3941fb that belongs to the
same patchset -- kmem_cache_free(NULL) is illegal and so will oops.
A curious coincidence is that you do see sysfs_new_dirent() in the
stack trace there, but the oops there is in kmem_cache_free(), not
kmem_cache_zalloc() as your dmesg output indicated.
Try that patch anyway, but I don't think that'll solve your problem --
if it was, you would've been seeing "unable to handle kernel NULL
pointer dereference" but what you've been posting is "unable to
handle kernel paging request at virtual address <non_null_ptr>" ...
Gaah.
And the worst thing about it all is that we're not able to trigger the
oops with debugging options -- that backtrace is horrible, so I'd
suggest CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER, at the very least. And also
perhaps DEBUG_INFO while we're at it -- that'll make later
analysis easier, if nothing else.
[ BTW I couldn't even get my compiler to generate the same
"Code:" as we saw in your dmesg (I suspect all the oopsen
have occurred with DEBUG=n, yes?) so my earlier analysis
that suspected SLUB's page->lockless_freelist in slab_alloc()
as the source of that invalid kernel address was actually
based on some human-work rather than simple tools doing
their thing. Gaah, again! ]
I'm thoroughly mystified ... Christoph? Tejun? Someone?
