The current cpu offline essentially just runs a special idle loop.
The standard idle loop is even a bit more aggressive on some systems
because it knows about the deeper ACPI sleep modi.
There are also dependencies between cores because current CPUs
have shared power planes between cores.
I suppose in the future when a whole socket goes off line one could
implement special code to turn off the CPU further. But it likely
won't work on older hardware.
