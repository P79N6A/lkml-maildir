Hello,
I've just rebooted a machine, and the eagle ADSL modem I was using,
presented as /proc/bus/usb/002/005 in now presented as 
/proc/bus/usb/002/003 (same bus, but device ID changed from 5 to 3).
Is this an expected behavior, when running a 2.4.31 kernel ?
I would have been expecting some more stability in the numbering across
reboot, the same way IDE disks numbers are stable.
Paul
