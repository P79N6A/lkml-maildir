How about: when devfs is mounted, kernel opens a handle to a file called
"devfs.permissions" on the mount point. Then device ownership and
permissions are stored on the physical filesystem.
This could be overridden with a parameter to the kernel to tell it we
don't want persistent information *at all* (eg for embedded systems).
