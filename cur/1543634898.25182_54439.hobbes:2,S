It means that the ethernet driver's Rx interrupt handler was not
able to allocate a new receive buffer - there wasn't enough memory
available.
The `kswapd' kernel thread is supposed to make memory available
for interrupt context but in this case it is obviously not keeping
up.
The driver recovers from the failed allocation, so things are OK.
