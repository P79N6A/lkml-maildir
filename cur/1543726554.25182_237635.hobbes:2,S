We're paying for past sins here.  I think it would be better to create a
new version of pci_alloc_consistent() which takes gfp_flags, then migrate
the drivers you care about to use it.  That way the benefit is available on
non-preempt kernels too.
The ultimate aim of course would be to deprecate then remove the old
function.
