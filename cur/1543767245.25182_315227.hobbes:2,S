Having a mount owner is not a problem.  Having a good policy for
accepting mounts is rather more so, according to some:
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107705608603071&w=2
Just a little taste of what that policy would involve:
  - global limit on user mounts
  - possibly per user limit on mounts
  - acceptable mountpoints (unlimited writablity is probably a good minimum)
  - acceptable mount options (nosuid, nodev are obviously not)
  - filesystems "safe" to mount by users
I'm not against something like that, but I'd like to hear other
people's opinion before trying to push a solution to mainline.
Thanks,
Miklos
