You may not have to drop that information either, I agree that it is
convenient to make the BAR a parameter, and you still have the chip
name anyway. But you can use pci_device_id.driver_data to store an
arbitrary identifier for each device, and use that identifier to lookup
the chip name, BAR or any other information you'd want to attach to the
devices.
Something like this:
static struct pci_device_id divil_pci[] = {
	{ PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_NS,  PCI_DEVICE_ID_NS_CS5535_ISA),
		     .driver_data = 0 },
	{ PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMD, PCI_DEVICE_ID_AMD_CS5536_ISA),
		     .driver_data = 1 },
	{ } /* NULL entry */
};
static struct {
	char *name;
	int bar;
} divil_data[] = {
	{ "CS5535", 0},
	{ "CS5536", 0},
};
That's just an idea anyway, there might be other ways to get there.
