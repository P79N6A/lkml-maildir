           This adds the CPUFreq driver for mobile AMD Opteron/Athlon64 
processors.
+         An acpi interface is available if acpi support has been selected.
+         This is required for multi-socket and other systems but not 
necessarily required for UP single socket systems.
           For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.
           If in doubt, say N.

-       depends on X86_POWERNOW_K8 && ACPI_PROCESSOR

+       help
+           This provides access to the acpi tables for full p-state 
functionality. This driver is also required
+           for cpufreq to work with multi-socket and other smp systems.
+
+           It is safe to say Y here.
