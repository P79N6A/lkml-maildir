Hi,
I agree with Randy here; this does not make sense. Either you're ok with
a small risk that the config doesn't match the kernel (and you
use /boot/config-<version> as put there by make install and by all
distributions) or you want a 100.00% guarantee and use /proc/config.gz.
Making the later unreliable (even if that is a CHOICE a user of it
cannot find this out, in the config.gz he sees the CONFIG option for
this may say =y even if the actual config has it as module!. So users of
this are now in the cold).
One hack we could do is make an md5sum or similar of the config and
stick that somewhere which is built in and always available (proc or
sysfs or something like that); that can be used to validate any config
basically to be "correct matching". In fact we could even make it
(optionally) part of the VERMAGIC to avoid any kind of mismatch at all.
