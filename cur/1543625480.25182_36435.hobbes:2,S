I would disagree. According to the spec "The iovcnt argument is valid
if greater than 0 and less than or equal to {IOV_MAX}, as defined in
<limits.h>" (
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/
).
The behaviour you want to achieve is described as optional, besides
there is programs depending on the old behaviour (of my own at least :).
It's very handy to skip extra zero-parameter check...
