Yes.  More, rp_filter is activated on all interfaces.

There's no.

Again: All the IP addresses mentioned are local to this box.
If you ping an IP address on your eth0, the traffic will "go"
over loopback.  You can verify it using tcpdump:
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP> mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:a0:d2:1d:a7:63 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.1/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global eth0
# tcpdump -npi lo proto ICMP
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on lo, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 96 bytes
