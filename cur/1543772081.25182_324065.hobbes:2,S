Yes, it's every device that wants to enable MSI.  So far, only one
driver that wants to enable MSI, has to handle broken devices.  And odds
are, that driver just isn't tested properly yet :)
So I stand by my decision now, it's just too complex to enable MSI for
everyone and expect drivers to disable it properly if they need to.  The
logic is just convoluted (see the patch for details.)  As proof, I got
it completly wrong the first time, and I'm still not sure that I got it
correct after working on this for a while. :)
In the end, the pci_enable/pci_disable interface is the way to go.
thanks,
