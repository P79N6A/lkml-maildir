[S390] kprobes breaks BUG_ON
The illegal operation handler calls the die notifier with DIE_BPT to
let kprobes pick up its breakpoint. If kprobes does not find its
breakpoint it returns NOTIFY_STOP instead of NOTIFY_DONE.
Since we use stop_machine_run on s390 to arm/disarm the kprobes
breakpoints the race that kprobe_handler tries to solve by checking
for the kprobes breakpoints does not exist. Removing the check makes
BUG_ON working again.
