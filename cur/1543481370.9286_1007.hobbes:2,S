Hello,
As I am not on the linux-kernel list currently, I would appreciate it if
you could please CC me (that funky looking From: address will get your
reply back to me :-) on any responses.
I am updating the ISC's DHCP package for Linux 2.[12].  Specifically I
am dealing with the networking changes in the 2.[12] kernels that
require substantial changes in the way the ISC DHCP's dhcp client works.
I am using the new Linux Packet Filter for doing some of the job.  It is
cool stuff, but I am running into a problem.  In <linux/filter.h> there
is a structure defined:
    struct sock_filter      /* Filter block */
    {
            u16   code;   /* Actual filter code */
            u8    jt;     /* Jump true */
            u8    jf;     /* Jump false */
            u32   k;      /* Generic multiuse field */
    };
which is required by the userspace "setsockopt()" call to install the
filter.
The problem is however, when I include <linux/filter.h> the u* types are
not defined.  I cannot find a header file that defines them for
userspace programs.  <asm/types.h> has the definitions that I want, but
they are wrapped with a _KERNEL_ macro.
Any ideas on how to best handle this situation?
BTW:  I seem to be getting a:
dhclient uses obsolete (PF_INET,SOCK_PACKET)
message as well.  If somebody can point me to what has obsoleted this
facility I will see about updating that part of the dhcp client as well.
Much thanks,
b.
