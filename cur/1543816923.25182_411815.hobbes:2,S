Hi,
I feel like I mist be dreaming, but this patch, which was inlcuded
in Linus' tree as 40c07ae8daa659b8feb149c84731629386873c16 calls
__you_cannot_kzalloc_that_much(), but that does not seem to exist.
On i386 at least that causes a build failure
# make mrproper
# make allyesconfig
# make 
[snip]
drivers/built-in.o: In function `kzalloc':include/linux/slab.h:128: undefined reference to `__you_cannot_kzalloc_that_much'
:include/linux/slab.h:128: undefined reference to
`__you_cannot_kzalloc_that_much'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
