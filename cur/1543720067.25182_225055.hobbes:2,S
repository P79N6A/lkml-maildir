Please post more information.  First, what size is the disk?
The LBAsect number suggests an access around 108 Gb.  If the disk is smaller
than this, then it would appear that a request was made for a non-existant
sector.
Is the LBAsect number the same in each error?  What is the machine doing
when the errors occur?
John.
