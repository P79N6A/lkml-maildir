Hmm, apparently your X uses ioperm() while mine uses iopl(), and i only 
turned off the renicing for iopl. (I fixed this in my tree and it will 
show up in -v6.)

note that CFS handles negative nice levels differently from other 
schedulers, so the disadvantages of agressively reniced X (lost 
throughput due to overscheduling, worse interactivity) do _not_ apply to 
CFS.
I think the 'fair' setting would be whatever the scheduler writer 
recommends: for SD, X probably performs better at around nice 0 (i'll 
let Con correct me if his experience is different). On CFS, nice -10 is 
perfectly fine too, and you'll have a zippier desktop under higher 
loads. (on servers this might be unnecessary/disadvantegous so there 
this can be turned off.)
(also, in my tree i've changed the default from -19 to -10 to make it 
less scary to people and to leave more levels to the sysadmin, this 
change too will show up in -v6.)
