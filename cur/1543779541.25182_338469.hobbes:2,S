(I think) I found the reason for this behaviour:
Upon card removal the functions
~ # cardctl eject
ide_release(398)
ide_unregister(585): index=0
blk_unregister_queue(3603)
elv_unregister_queue(549)
ide_unregister(698)
ide_detach(164)
are called. Thus the request queue for the drive is discarded which is fair 
enough. But disk->queue would still point to a (now invalid) request_queue_t 
structure. Thus if I/O requests (e.g. "umount") are started _after_ the drive 
was removed bad things can happen! So I think we should explicitly remove the 
reference to that queue by doing
void blk_unregister_queue(struct gendisk *disk)
{
	request_queue_t *q = disk->queue;
	if (q && q->request_fn) {
		elv_unregister_queue(q);
		kobject_unregister(&q->kobj);
+		disk->queue = NULL;
		kobject_put(&disk->kobj);
	}
}
in drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c
Then instead of a crash or hang one would get
~ # umount /mnt/pcmcia/
...
generic_shutdown_super(249) calling sop->put_super @ c00ac734
fat_clusters_flush(49)
generic_make_request: Trying to access nonexistent block-device hda1 (1)
FAT: bread failed in fat_clusters_flush
Thanks a million.
