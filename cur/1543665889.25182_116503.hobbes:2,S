Hi, 
    I am currently involved in developing network
driver for gigabit ethernet card under Linux. I would
like to test the driver I develop with the "Fault
injection test harness" that comes as a patch for
Kernel 2.5. Now my question is, what kernel version
would be advisable to write the driver on? Is it too
much of a porting work from kernel 2.4 which is
reasonably stable, to finally test with the hardening
tool.and will it be a risk developing on kernel 2.5
development series? or how stable is kernel 2.5?
Kindly suggest the latest kernel version I can work on
inorder to use the hardening tool. Please CC your
answers to my personal ID as I am not subscribed to
the list.
Thanks
Sripriya
