For the attack in question, it does, as long as no two consecutive
passwords have the same number of characters.
For example, if the list of OTPs is:
alpha
beta
epsilon
The user logs in using the first password, and somebody logs that it
has five characters.  The next valid password, (the only valid one),
has four.
