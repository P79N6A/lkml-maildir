Hi All,
I am looking for some source code or a document which outlines how to open 
a TCP connection within kernel space.
After many google searches, and a search of the archives, I cannot seem to 
find an example which says "do this".
There are many references to sk_buff and friends, but nothing more 
practical.
I have looked over khttpd, which has been some help, and I looked briefly 
at the nfs code, but I don't want to use RPC.
Can anybody point me to a document/code/patch to help me out ?
For more information, I basically want to emulate a userland 
gethostbyname() in kernel space.
Thanks
Jody
