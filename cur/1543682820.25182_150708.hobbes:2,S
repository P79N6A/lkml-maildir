Subject: [2.6.0-test1] ACPI slowdown

If I enable ACPI on my box (Athlon XP at 1.6 GHz, Epox EP-8KHa+
mainboard), it becomes very slow (so slow that it's unusable).
Is this a known issue?  Maybe the thermal limits are misconfigured,
and the CPU clock is throttled unnecessarily (if something like this
is supported at all).
