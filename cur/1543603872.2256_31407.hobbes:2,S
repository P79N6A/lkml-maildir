Subject: Initrd on 2.4.10, any way to use 2.4.10 but use 2.4.9s initrd?

In 2.4.10, the initrd support appears to be broken. When loading the initrd at startup, it appears to try and load the initrd, but immediately after initialising, it says "unloaded initrd, xxxx kb freed" and then goes into a panic (because there's no root or init).
Is it possible to use the 2.4.10 Kernel but with 2.4.9's initrd support? What would I do in order to take the code over?
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Jon
