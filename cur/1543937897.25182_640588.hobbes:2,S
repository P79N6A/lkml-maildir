Why are we rushing so much to do 64-bit paravirt that we are breaking
working configurations?  If the developement is going to be this
chaotic, it should be done and tested out of tree until it can
stabilize.
I do not like having to continuously retest and review the x86 branch
because the paravirt-ops are constantly in flux and the 32-bit code
keeps breaking.
We won't be doing 64-bit paravirt-ops for exactly this reason - is there
a serious justification from the performance angle on modern 64-bit
hardware?  If not, why justify the complexity and hackery to Linux?
