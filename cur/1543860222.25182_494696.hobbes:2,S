That would indeed be a horrible bug. However, we don't do 
"clear_page_dirty()" _after_ the IO has completed, we do it _before_ the 
IO starts.
If you can actually find a place that does clear_page_dirty _after_ IO, 
then yes, you've just found the bug. But I haven't found it.
So the rule is _always_:
 - call "clear_page_dirty_for_io()" with the page lock held, and _before_ 
   the IO starts.
 - do "set_page_writeback()" before unlocking the page again
 - do a "end_page_writeback()" when the IO actually finishes.
and any code sequence that doesn't honor those rules would be buggy. A 
beer for anybody that finds it..
