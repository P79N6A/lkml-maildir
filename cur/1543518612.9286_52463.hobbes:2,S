Then run the same kernel on each. It's what you'll be doing anyway, I'd
suspect.

Great. Start removing optimizations for binary module compatibility's sake.

It's close to no hassle in this particular case. And probably similar in
other optimizations you will end up deleting afterwards. And then you'll go
after those were they went to the hassle _because_ it makes a significant
difference in performance.
No, thanks.
