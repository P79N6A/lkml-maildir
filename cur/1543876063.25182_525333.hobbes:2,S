Its how all Unix/Linux like systems behave. You have to clear the memory
to something to deal with security on any kind of real system, and zero
is a good a value as any

mmap() for anonymous memory pools should not normally be a hot path,
because the C library malloc is supposed to show some brains. If you need
special behaviour (eg for performance hacks) then create yourself
a /dev/zero like device which just maps uncleared pages. Its not much
code and it keeps special cases out of the core kernel.
