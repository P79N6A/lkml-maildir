I played with an approach where you can bind a dentry to a set of
memory zones, and any children of that dentry would inherit the
mempolicy; I was envisaging that most data wouldn't be shared between
different containers/jobs, and that userspace would set up "shared"
zones for big shared regions such as /lib, /usr, /bin, and for
specially-known cases of sharing.

move_pages() will let you shuffle tasks from one node to another
without too much intrusion.
