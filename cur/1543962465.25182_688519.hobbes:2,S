Me too please ;)
Please note there is a related problem if we have a single thread but
a lot of timers attached to this thread. If the signal is ignored, each
timer should be re-armed, this all can consume >= 1/HZ CPU time.
We have "maxfire = 20" in check_thread_timers/check_process_timers to
prevent this, but it is just a workaround. And it is a bit silly to just
waste the CPU if the signal is ignored, arm_timer() is heavy and doesn't
scale well.
However, I have already forgot this code, perhaps I missed something,
and at least maxfire does help.
Oleg.
