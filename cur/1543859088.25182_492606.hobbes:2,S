Maybe it's just a matter of perception.  I don't see it that way from
the inside.
How about
http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/rt/readsay.html?filename=gplv3-draft-2&id=2238
Would it help address your mis-perception?

Yeah, but that's a Straw Man.

I believe you and I have already shot down the 'ld-is-like-mkisofs'
argument.

No, that's how it defines 'work based on the Program', see the quoted
portion below.

I can't see where you drew that conclusion from, but it's an incorrect
conclusion.  Program can denote the sources as much as the binaries.

/me looks again
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)
> In other words, in the GPL, "Program" does NOT mean "binary". Never has.
Agreed.  So what?  How does this relate with the point above?
The binary is a Program, as much as the sources are a Program.  Both
forms are subject to copyright law and to the license, in spite of

People do many odd things.  How do you define source code and object
code to other things that are not programs.

Exactly.  No disagreement here.
I'm not disputing this fact.
In the point you quoted above, I was only disputing your argument of
"mere aggregation" in the context of dynamic linking.
