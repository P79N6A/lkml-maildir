Well, it is based off of the standard ADMA[1] specification, albeit with 
modifications.  There is pdc_adma.c, which is also based off ADMA.  And 
the author (from NVIDIA) claims that the driver worked at one time, so 
maybe it is simply bit rot that broke the driver.
If I knew the answer, it would be fixed, so the best answer 
unfortunately is "who knows".
I wish I had the time.  But I also wish I had a team of programmers 
working on libata, too ;-)
