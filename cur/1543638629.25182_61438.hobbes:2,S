This afternoon I sent a small patch fixing some oopses in the
partition code. However, I now see that it is not difficult to
provoke many related oopses not fixed by the simple test for
non-NULL parent.
So, a more thorough accounting is needed of
driverfs_create_partitions() and driverfs_remove_partitions().
