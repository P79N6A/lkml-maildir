Hello,
I was using 2.6.15 without trouble but wanna try the new 2.6.16
version so I compiled it by myself without much hassle. All worked
fine but ALSA.
My sound device is the following:
0000:00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 04)
and it stoped to work. Would someone know anything about it? it's a
regressions if compared to 2.6.15.
If you wish something more, please let me know.
Thanks in advance,
