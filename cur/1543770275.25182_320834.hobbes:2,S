What has that to do with anything? I doubt that suggestions about boot 
options are on the website or come from the Tyan website, either.
Note: I'm not endorsing LinuxBIOS for Opteron, I haven't personally 
tried it. But the value of the suggestion depends on how it works, not 
who makes it. There appear to be a lot of reports of problems with 
Opteron lately, if the BIOS isn't buggy then the documentation may have 
lost in translation.
