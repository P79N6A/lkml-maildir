You could in principle base version numbers on external influences. In a
5-point decimal system, then 2.6.x.y.z would be released daily, 2.6.x.y.0
released every 10 days, 2.6.x.0.0 released every 100 days, and 2.7.0.0.0
released after 1000 days, and so on.
Similarly for patches instead of days; an 8-point decimal system could
be released based on the number of patches merged. 2.6.u.v.w.x.y.z
would be "released" for every patch merged, 2.6.u.v.w.x.y.0 released
for every 10 patches, 2.6.u.v.w.x.0.0 released for every 100 patches,
2.6.u.v.w.0.0.0 for every 1000 patches, 2.6.u.v.0.0.0.0 released after
10000 patches, 2.6.u.0.0.0.0.0 released after 100000 patches, and
2.7.0.0.0.0.0 released after 1000000 patches. Or perhaps a natural
number merely counting the number of patches merged suffices.
In both decimal systems, 0 <= u, v, w, x, y, z < 10.
This will ultimately be defeated by anticipatory behavior regarding
magic numbers (lots of 0's) and divergent trees, though I actually sort
of like the 8-point decimal system based on patches merged or otherwise
counting the number of patches merged, since it would provide a method
of referring to all states of the tree, enabling binary search for bugs.
But I highly doubt anything of these kinds will happen, and they're
largely orthogonal to the issue of users being scared of how big the
tree has gotten and not being able to understand that large numbers of
patches must be interpreted relative to the size of the codebase
instead of in absolute terms.
