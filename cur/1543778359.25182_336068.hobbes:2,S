Ironically, Microsoft offers a choice here.
In the registry (NT and W2K at least, don't know about XP:)
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Session Manager\Memory Management
        LargeSystemCache : REG_DWORD
                0: prefer application code over cached data
                1: prefer cached data
Also:
        DisablePagingExecutive : REG_DWORD
                1: don't allow kernel code to be paged out
        IOPageLockLimit : REG_DWORD
                controls the amount of memory that can be locked for I/O
