I think this might be due to a buggy "raidstop".  I seem to recall
someone having a similar problem some months ago.  It turned out that
they we using a vendor supplied raidstop that did the wrong thing.
Could you try compiling raid-tools from 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/raid/alpha/raidtools-19990824-0.90.tar.bz2
   
and see if that works.
Alternaltely, get mdctl from
  
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdctl/
and use 
   mdctl --stop /dev/md0
If this still doesn't work, please send me an "strace" of raidstop
running and failing.
