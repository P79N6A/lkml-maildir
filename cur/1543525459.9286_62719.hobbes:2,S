Funny.
You see, many older versions of rm will give an error message
when called without argument:
# rm -f
Usage: rm [-dfirvR] [--directory] [--force] [--interactive] [--recursive]
       [--verbose] path...
So, a construction like
	rm -f core `find stuff`
is meant to make sure that rm has at least one argument.
This is not the directory name, but a dummy filename,
chosen such that we don't mind if it is actually removed.
