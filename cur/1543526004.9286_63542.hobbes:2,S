There IS solution. It's in kernel now. It's called "unmount". If you ejecting
your floppy without umount you filesystem CAN be ruined. If you are doing this
without umount you should expect ruined filesystem. Once supermount is considered
"normal" such protection is gone. There also exist Windows's "solution" (see
below).
See ? With explicit mount/unmount ruined filesystem is USER'S failt (he did
not unmounted floppy even if shitty hardware teased his/her it's still USER'S
fault). With suportmout/automount/whatever it's LINUX'S fault (user did not
done anything illigal while files was lost). Hence bad press and so on.
So we replaced small evil ("Oh linux is so hard to use: you should mount
floppies and cds with explicit mount") with bigger one ("I've not done anything
illegal and still Linux ruined my spreadshit/database/whatever"). Windows not
uses serial numbers on floppies and ask you to insert "right one" back if it's
taken out to fast but IMO such change will require more then just small rework
of VFS (how to ask user to put disk back if said user can used X Window ?).
To Viro: Am I wrong ?
