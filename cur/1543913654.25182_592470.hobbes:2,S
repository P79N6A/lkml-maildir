You seem to be jumping to conclusion without going
in detail. The pci_dev struct contains pointer to sysdata,
which in turn points to the copy of its parent's bus sysdata.
So technically speaking we can eliminate sysdata pointer from
pci_dev struct which is what one portion of this patch does.

I looked at your patch and it was not suitable because I need to store
iommu private pointer in pci_dev and not in the pci_bus. So I have added
a new member sys_data in the pci_dev struct. I can change the name from 
sys_dev to iomu_priv to clear the confusion. Do let me know.
