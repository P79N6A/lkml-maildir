Fixed in linus-latest.
Note that the changes to kernel-doc make it spit out warnings for
all parameters in a funtion which is not documented.
A better solution might be to spit out warnings for parameters
documented but not present.
My perl skills did not suffer for this.
The real errors were in one .tmpl files and one .c file,
The other changes in kernel-doc just helped me identifying the root
cause.

I cannot provoke this one. Anyone with more details?
Otherwise I would like to have it closed.

Alan Cox checked in a correction that was present in 2.5.66.
I have tried "make rpm" with 2.5.70 with success.
Can be closed.
