  In principle, the patch looks fine. The only thing I'm wondering about
is how that panic can happen... Journal write_revoke_records() is called
from journal_commit_transaction() when revoke table for the committing
transaction shouldn't see any further changes. So maybe the patch is
masking a different problem.
  Do you have a way of reproducing the problem? Any stack trace
available?
