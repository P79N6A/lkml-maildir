Simply: If you move the Logitech too fast, it'll lose track. The reason
why the Duial Optical has two sensors to help exactly this problem - a
diagonally oriented sensor can cope up with 41% faster movement.
Thus they get about 50 centimeters per second maximum tracking speed. If
you move the mouse fast, it'll lose track, and the pointer will move
randomly.
With the Explorer 3.0, it's almost impossible to get it lose track, at
100 centimeters/second maximum tracking speed.
It might be that due to the 800 dpi resolution you won't need to move it
so fast ...

Btw, for more frequent reporting it's enough to modify the irq interrupt
rate in the HID driver, works for any mouse.
