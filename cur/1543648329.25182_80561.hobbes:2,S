In an effort to avoid this patch to die before in someone's mailbox I am
bringing it back....
As requested by Linus I am forwarding this to you Neil for review/inclusion
in a soon-to-be released 2.5.* version
Trond has looked at it and has given thumbs up but I think he said he was
too busy to put it in.
I have not gotten any answer from Marcelo either to include this in 2.4.*
so I will resend that to you as well, its basically the same single line
patch...

Nope, sorry, it's lost somewhere. Can you get Neil to look them over too,
I have a hard time judging anything that has to do with lockd..

Linus,
Would you please review the attached patch and include in the dist?
If fixes a faulty delay experienced by lockd clients just after the grace
period and during the first request to lockd.
