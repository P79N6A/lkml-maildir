Most of it is in there anyway - the kernel code needs to check the image
exists and read the header irrespective of whether it does sanity
checking. In Suspend2, this code is also used for other error conditions
that can stop you being able to resume (failure to load the right
modules in an initrd, failure at accessing the device where the image
should be found etc).

Yes. The real solution is for all kernels on a system to either support
suspend to disk or not support it. Half measures are what cause the
problem.

Mmm. I know it's all possible, but I'm pointing out the issues that make
it not "trivial", which was the original claim.

How so? You then have to maintain two codebases for doing all this
reading and parsing.

So don't use kernels that aren't suspend2 patched :>
If someone said "I want to boot a kernel that doesn't have support for
ext3 but my rootfs is ext3", would we say "Well then, write a userspace
ext3 driver"? Not exactly the same, I know, but I think the point
stands. We'd say "Don't be silly. Put in the support you need."
The real solution to this mess is to get distros compiling in support
for suspend-to-disk by default. I realise that hasn't been attractive.
Hopefully it will change real-soon-now.

Nigel
