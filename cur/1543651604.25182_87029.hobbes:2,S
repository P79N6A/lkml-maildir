You may be in luck - we likely need to have an ioctl to do this from
e2fsck because the ext3 htree repacking of bad directories is causing
a bunch of problems.  In theory, the startup scripts should reboot the
system in this case, but there have also been cases reported where
people ran "e2fsck -D" on an ro-mounted root and then read-write mounted
it again.
Cheers, Andreas
