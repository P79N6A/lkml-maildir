   0.91g has "testing" on it. So even Donald doesn't trust it. You want me to
   put that in a stable kernel. Not unless Donald says so.
Also remember that we can't merge in any of Donald's latest Tulip
drivers until someone does the fast routing support additions.
It is unacceptable to lose this feature which several people depend
upon now in 2.2.x with Tulip cards.
