Subject: [PATCH 2/6] checkpatch: type/cast spacing should not check prefix spacing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/12/159

We should not be complaining about the prefix spacing for types and
casts.  We are triggering here because the check for spacing between
'*'s is overly loose.  Tighten this up.
