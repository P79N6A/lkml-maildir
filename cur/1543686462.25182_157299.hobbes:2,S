Yes, one can enable or disable DEBUG_INFO as soon as DEBUG_KERNEL is selected, 
this does not depend on KGDB.
With the patch DEBUG_INFO is enabled by default only if KGDB is selected, but 
even if KGDB is not selected you still may enable it by hand.
The problem was that DEBUG_INFO was enabled even if it was not reachable 
because DEBUG_KERNEL was not selected....
