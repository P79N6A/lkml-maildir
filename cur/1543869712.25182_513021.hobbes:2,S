Let me express my unsorted points:
1. It is certainly OK in kernel, if it is not OK in user-space, 'make
headers_install' should remove the __attribute__ stuff.
2. I failed to find __atribute__ stuff in ISO C99, so it is not
standard. _BUT_ there are many non-C99 assumptions in kernel anyway. So
"non ISO C" is a weak argument anyway.
3. 
[dedekind@mordor ubi-2.6.git]$ make headers_install
 .... [snip]
[dedekind@mordor include]$ grep -r packed * | wc -l
117
This is the _fact_ of life.
4. Nonetheless, I do not mind at all to remove the "packed" stuff if you
can guarantee that all this compilers on all platforms will use it as
packed. Otherwise we should play safe instead.
Artem.
