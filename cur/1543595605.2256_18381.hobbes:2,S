Grrr, how did I miss this before?  I thought Xuan's hang went away after
pre3, so I didn't look into this trace hard enough.  
Reiserfs expects write_inode() calls initiated by kswapd to always have
sync==0.  Otherwise, kswapd ends up waiting on the log, which isn't what we
want at all.
The dirty inode callback ensures there are no dirty inodes that haven't
been logged.  I took the sync parameter to mean it is initiated by fsync or
O_SYNC, so I trigger a full commit when sync == 1.
So, my choices are to ignore sync == 1 write_inode calls when kswapd is
doing it, or make a private inode dirty list.

The trace above is caused by the dirty inode problem, the I think the more
recent trace is something different.
