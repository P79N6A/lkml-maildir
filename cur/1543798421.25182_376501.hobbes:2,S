Indeed the implementation I currently have is lightweight to say the least but 
I really didn't think bloating struct page was worth it since the memory cost 
would be prohibitive, but would allow all sorts of priority effects and vm 
scheduling to be possible. That is, struct page could have an extra entry 
keeping track of the highest priority of the process that used it and use 
that to determine further eviction etc.
