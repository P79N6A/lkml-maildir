Your problem is different from anyone else's, as I explained.
You see "netdev watchdog" message first.
It means that the card just stopped to transmit packets.
All other messages printed after that, including wait_for_cmd_done timeout,
are irrelevant to this problem.  Your card just doesn't transmit.
Please send me a complete log of what the kernel prints, since powering up
the computer.
