Hi all...
Just a couple questions about the crypto routines present in kernel:
- Are they just for in-kernel use, some like encrypted filesystems, or can
  it be used from userspace ?
- It it is usable from userland, has it any advantage over doing it in
  userspace ? IE, for example, can ssh be faster it used the kernel crypto ?
- If so, how ? Special library ? syscalls ?
If this is on a faq everywhere, a pointer is just enough, thanks.
TIA
