Thank you for the reply back.  Your answer makes perfect sense to me, 
and it is what I had suspected but was not sure about.  The math seems 
to indicate that 4Gb of ram plus 1Gb of PCI address space equals 5Gb of 
memory space.  So it does sound like I should have a larger kernel model.
What confused me the most (and still does), is the help message string 
that is presented for the CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G option:
  "Select this if you have a 32-bit processor and between 1 and 4 
gigabytes of physical RAM."
Well that sounds like the amount of memory that I have, so that is what 
I selected.
Also, although I know what PAE stands for, I don't know how to select it 
when building a kernel.  Would I get this from the CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G 
option?  The help text for that says:
  "Select this if you have a 32-bit processor and more than 4 gigabytes 
of physical RAM."
This does not sound like it applies to my hardware.  There is something 
wrong with my understanding, or with these message strings.  I am still 
confused.
