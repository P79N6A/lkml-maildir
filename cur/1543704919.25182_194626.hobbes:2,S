I just checked again with 2.6.2-rc2. It occurs right after pnpbios
starts up. I wrote the oops down by hand since the computer went into a
hard lockup (no sysrq key), but couldn't get any results out of
ksymoops for some reason (maybe I am misusing it, any way to disable
pnpbios on a kernel compiled with so I can run it from the running
kernel?).
I attached the oops log and the dmi data (didn't know what is needed of
it).
