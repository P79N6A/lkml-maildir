Another thing very important to mention is that the layering
infrastructure should _not_ be broken, whereby LLDD are required
to use block layer tags.
First, there may not be one to one correspondence accross layers.
Second, a tag on a layer identifies that particular _layer_ object.
It should not be used across layers or across several layers:
Block->Scsi Core->LLDD.
Third, although SCSI task tags are a SAM concept, they are defined
by the protocol in use and generated and assigned by the Initiator
port.  The block layer is _not_ an Initiator port.  SCSI Core is
also _not_ an Initiator port.
SCSI Core should be impervious to task tags, i.e. to the Q in
I_T_L_Q nexus.  The Q is never visible to it.
