You don't happen to have that patch available (in current form, of course)
somewhere for download do you? 
couldn't find a web site with your patches either, except for the ARM site,
and your personal page there...  Do you have a page with all of your misc
patches?
Also noticed there isn't a ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rmk...
