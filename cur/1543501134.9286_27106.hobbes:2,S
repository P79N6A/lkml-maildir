hi.
	I'd just like to inquire about the status of the driver for the
ESS Maestro. It first appeared in one of the 2.2.9-ac patches.
We're trying to use it on a Maestro-1 card. The module loads OK, but we
can't get any meaningful sound out of it. Sometimes noise or garbage,
sometimes nothing.
We'd like to get in contact with whoever is working on this driver, and
get any documentation you might have. Alan?
bye
