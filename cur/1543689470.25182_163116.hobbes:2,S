Ok, I'm mostly happy that it isn't a generic PCMCIA bug as such now -
it seems that orinoco_cs may be passing a mask which doesn't include
any reasonable IRQs, or the two available IRQs (7 and 4) are already
in use by other devices.
Hmm, I wonder if we could fall back to the PCI IRQ when this occurs.
Unfortunately I can't look into the issue as deeply as I'd like at
present, so I'll create a "wouldn't it be nice if" (WIBNI) list of
things to do on pcmcia.arm.linux.org.uk.
