There are couple of issues that need to be checked -
1. Re-doing the parent comparison and full name under ->d_lock
need to be benchmarked using dcachebench. That part of code
is extrememly performance sensitive and I remember that the
current d_movecount based solution was done after a lot of
benchmarking of various alternatives.
2. We need to check if doing ->d_compare() under ->d_lock will
result in locking hierarchy problems.
