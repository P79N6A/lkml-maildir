That's a much better (== content-ful) explanation; thanks Russell.
Cache line sharing can indeed be a PITA ... and while it's an issue
that's not unique to DMA from the stack, it's something that's less
manageable there.  Plus, DMA isn't always cache-coherent.  Meaning
that for example DMA to the stack might bypass the cache and then
later be overwritten by flushing cached stack updates.  (etc.)
