This says NULL is the identity function, which is not the same as:
    static void null_encrypt(void *ctx, u8 *dst, const u8 *src)
    { }
In practice this code never gets called because cbc_process() has
a special case for iv==NULL.  But I'd rather see a semantically
correct reference implementation.  Or just leave .cia_encrypt=NULL.
Am I missing something here ?
