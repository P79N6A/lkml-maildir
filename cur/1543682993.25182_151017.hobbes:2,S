This is not the real problem, IMHO.
If the counter is public, you can read it repeatedly to measure the
intervals between keypresses.  If you take pair-wise timing into
account, you can narrow the search space considerably.
There's a detailed paper about the issue:

(Even if the title says SSH, it applies to the public counter scenario
as well.)
