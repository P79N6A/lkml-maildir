Am OK with all of that, but with a rider.  It would make my life even more
miserable if there was a (say) git-scsi-tweedledee and a
git-scsi-tweedledum.  We already have too much out-of-scope code turning up
in the git trees and having two trees explicitly modifying the same
subsystem would hurt.  It's also bad from an engineering POV: there's a
decent chance that when combined, they just won't work.
So Tweedledee and Tweedledum should both commit to the same tree, please.
