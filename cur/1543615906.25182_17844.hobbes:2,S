Out of sheer curiosity (and this might be a stupid question), is there 
any effort to make the following lines of development all work together: 
RML's preempt-kernel and lock-break (and netdev, but that doesn't touch 
the other stuff), Rick's rmap VM, and the O(1) scheduler?  If so, is it 
being applied to 2.4 or 2.5? (Definately seems 2.5-ish, but given that 
all the patches are available for 2.4, I thought I'd ask.)
This system just got 2.4.18-pre1 with RML's preempt and Rick's rmap10c 
patches.  Seems stable though dbench 10 can take all responsiveness out 
of KDE (though XMMS never skips).  The O(1) scheduler did not apply, nor 
did lock-break, otherwise I would be running with all of the above.
Are any of these actually mutually exclusive? (that is, am I just 
wasting time and decreasing the s:n ratio on LKML?)
Thanks in advance.
