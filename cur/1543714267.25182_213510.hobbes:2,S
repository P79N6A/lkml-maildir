Likely just the opposite.  We have written a C compiler that does not
implicitly use memory.  Having had to reinvent the wheel a feel times
because of where we are working, it is clear that tools are your friend.
There is no shame in rewriting something when what exists does not work
for you and it matters.  If your rewrite happens to be significantly faster
than the broken version that is just a plus. :)
