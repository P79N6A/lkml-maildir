OK it looks like commit 6c152beefbf90579d21afc4f7e075b1f801f9a75 from
Richard Purdie, 'leds: Standardise LED naming scheme' introduced this
change.
Why do we need '::' instead of a single ':' (that would not have broken
things)?
Also sometimes only a single ':' seperator is used like in
corgi:green:mail but e.g. not in clevo::mail ?!
