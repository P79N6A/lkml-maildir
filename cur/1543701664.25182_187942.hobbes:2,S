Hi...
I notice a severe speed regression with 2.6 and working in e.g. xterm on
X11 (no framebuffer device in use). It is all about scrolling speed. I
used to type e.g. just dmesg in a fullscreen xterm (or MGT) in 2.4 and
the whole output was there lightning fast, i.e. 
in 2.4:
=======
time dmesg
real    0m0.096s
user    0m0.007s
sys     0m0.005s
in 2.6 (first run)
======
time dmesg
[...]
real    0m3.054s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.008s
in 2.6 (second run)
===================
dmesg >d
time cat d
real    0m0.096s
user    0m0.002s
sys 0m0.005s
in 2.6 (third run)
==================
time dmesg
real    0m0.095s
user    0m0.007s
sys     0m0.004s
So it is like 30 times slower on 2.6. when running for the first time...
this also happens if I do e.g. find ./ and watch the output pass by... 
This is without preemption on powerpc...
Anyone else with that problem - ideas of the cause ?
Soeren.
