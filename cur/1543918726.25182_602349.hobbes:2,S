I didn't think that nobbling config options for particular pv_ops
implementations was acceptable? I'm rather out of the loop though, and could
be wrong.
The PREEMPT_BITS limitation is a good argument for at least taking the pte
locks in small batches though (small batches is preferable to one-by-one
since we will want to batch the make-readonly-and-pin hypercall requests to
amortise the cost of the hypervisor trap).
