Yes. Reading/Modifying the loaded kexec image is another way to do
necessary communication between the first kernel and the second kernel.
In fact, the patch [4/4] of this series with title:
[PATCH 4/4 -mm] kexec based hibernation -v7 : kimgcore
provide a ELF CORE file in /proc (/proc/kimgcore) to read the loaded
kexec image. The writing function can be added easily.
But I think communication between the first kernel and the second kernel
via reading/modifying the loaded kernel image is not very convenient
way. The usage mode may be as follow:
- sys_kexec_load() /* with executable/data loaded */
- modify the loaded kexec image to set the parameters (A)
- sys_reboot(,,LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_KEXEC,) /* execute physical mode code with parameters(A)*/
- In physical mode code, check the parameters A and executing accordingly
- modify the loaded kexec image to set the parameters (B)
- sys_reboot(,,LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_KEXEC,) /* execute physical mode code with parameters(B)*/
- In physical mode code, check the parameters B and executing accordingly
There are some issues with this usage model:
- Some parameters in kernel needed to be exported (such as the
kimage->head to let the second kernel to read the memory contents of
backupped memory).
- The physical mode code invoker (the first kernel) need to know where
to write the parameters. A common protocol or a protocol case by case
should be defined. For example, the memory address after the entry point
of kexec image is a good candidate. But for Linux kernel, there are two
types of entry point, the "jump back entry" or "purgatory". Maybe
different protocol should be defined for these two types of entry point.
- For the user space of the second kernel to get the parameters. A
interface (maybe a file in /proc or /sys) should be provided to export
the parameters to user space.
So I think the current parameters passing mechanism may be more simple
and convenient (defined in Document/i386/jump_back_protocol.txt in the
patch).
There is only one user of var args. But I think it is simple to be
implemented and may be used by others.

Now, the user space is not shut down or started up across kexec/jump
back, just the sys_reboot call is used to trigger the kexec/jump back.
Maybe sys_reboot is not the right place to do this. Can you recommended
a more suitable place?

I plan to reduce the KEXEC_PRESERVE_XXX flags into one
KEXEC_PRESERVE_CONTEXT. The var args part may be changed if we have the
consensus.

After checking the history of machine_kexec_32.c, I find the pointer is
removed because a specific PGD is used. My reason is a little different.
I need save some information (the preserving registers, some control
registers, swap page address etc) in control_page, it is more convenient
to execute on identity map of control_page. I think it is not a big
issue. In fact, my code can work without making relocate_kernel to
pointer with some changes.

Yes. I think this is a good idea, and the kexec_pgd, kexec_pmd0/1,
kexec_pte0/1 can be allocated in machine_kexec_prepare too to save the
static memory usage.
