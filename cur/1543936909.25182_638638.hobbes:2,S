No, just that however the secid is determined (whether indirectly via
specification of a directory or directly via specification of a secid),
the ability of the daemon to control what secid gets used ought to be
controlled.  Or, alternatively, the ability of the daemon to enable
caching in a given directory ought to be controlled.
