I plan to send Marcelo all the IDE updates. Note btw the checking of the
return value on pci_enable_device is critical - some old kernels hang on
boot with crappy bioses through not checking.
What I begin to the think the right answer is, is to relax the IDE fixup
block in the i386 kernel boot up. Right now we avoid assigning
unassigned resources for IDE controllers. Clearly we should be doing so.
