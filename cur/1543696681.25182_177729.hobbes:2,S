The '|| !toc->capacity' part of that code exists because I have a DVD
drive that got zero capacity from the cdrom_get_last_written call.
The symptoms were exactly the same as above - I could mount and use the
thing correctly, but the raw device was not readable at all.
Maybe cdrom_read_capacity can also return zero for some broken
situations?
