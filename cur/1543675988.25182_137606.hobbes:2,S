I have a Soyo KT400 Dragon Ultra which would hang at boot unless I
specified "noapic".
linux-2.4.21-rc6-ac1 boots fine with APIC enabled, without the
"noapic" kernel parameter.
So, to install Mandrake 9.1, specify the "noapic" parameter, and once
installed, give linux-2.4.21-rc6-ac1 a try.
Alan, thanks for the fix.  I was beginning to wonder if my KT400
chipset would be supported by a stable kernel.
