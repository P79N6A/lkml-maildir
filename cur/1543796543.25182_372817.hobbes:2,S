By definition, using local addresses is probabilistic.  There are moron 
hardware manufacturers, as you show above (which aren't even the worst 
of the lot, from what I've seen), but your cross-section with other 
local-address users will be very small (collision only likely around 
2^23 nodes.)
Reducing the address space available to randomly pick from will only 
increase the likelihood of failure.
This is an instance where an understanding of statistics come into play.
