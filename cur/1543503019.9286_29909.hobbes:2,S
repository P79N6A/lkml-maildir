I hope to see TWO patches as the end result: for linux kernel (fairly small)
and for GLibC 2.1.x (fairly big). So it'll be really clear that your addition
to linux-kernel worth it and can be used as basis for good (and fast!
with 3usecs or so thread creation in LinuxThreads :-) emulation of POSIX
threads... Otherwise chance is high that some subtle problem with POSIX
threads emulation will not be adressed :-/
