Dear Livia,
Under Linux (as in any other UNIX-like OS) processes are created by means
of fork(2) system call. All system calls are prefixed with sys_ so, the
implementation of fork() is in sys_fork() function which is in
arch/i386/kernel/process.c file. If you build tags by means of this small
dotags script attached (from Pete Wyckoff), then you can easily lookup
things with:
vi -t sys_fork
Alternatively, you can compile the kernel with -g added to CFLAGS and use
gdb's list command to quickly lookup stuff.
As for termination, the system call _exit(2) is implemented in sys_exit()
(ok, it should be sys__exit() but that would be silly, so it is an
exception) of kernel/exit.c. A process can also terminate by a signal.
By looking at the sys_call_table[] of arch/i386/kernel/entry.S you can
learn how the sys_fork() function "becomes" a system call. It is also
instructive to notice the use of int 0x80 instruction to switch from user
to kernel mode when a system call is executed. This is in
include/asm-i386/unistd.h file, look at the _syscall*() macros.
Regards,

# Make my favorite tags file, without non-i386 architecture specific stuff,
# and replacing __initfunc with the function name it encloses.  Not sorting
# in ctags since stripping the __initfunc will produce previously unsorted
# tags.  Sort afterward.
#
# Someday do __initdata too.
