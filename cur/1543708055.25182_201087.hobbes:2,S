No. The current arch manuals seem to say nothing definite, but Intel's 
386 manual (ie, the cpu, not the arch) from 1986 explicitly says "after 
setting PG, a jump must follow immediately".

I believe you should either keep it as is, do the long jump (although I 
don't believe that to be necessary: setup.s already long jumped to us) 
or only delete the indirect jump (we've just been longjumped to, and 
identity-mapped, so everything would seem to be normalised already).
In any case, please jump directly after setting PG.
Rene.
