Interesting...
FWIW a much better transition path is very close to what your tool does,
and is a suggestion made by mec (kbuild maintainer) near the end of the
recent flamewar:  convert config.in files one at a time, like we did the
old makefiles.
That would imply a rewrite of make [old]config, and an updating of make
menu|xconfig, to handle the new format...
As it happened with the conversion to new-style Makefiles, Linus may say
"bah" when the conversion 80% there, and remove support for the old
config format completely.  :)
