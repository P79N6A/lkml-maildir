hc_crisv10 is long out-of-date and doesn't even build, as you saw.  Is 
anyone still using it?  It probably should be removed from the Makefile.
The line in drivers/usb/misc/uss720.c is just a comment.  Presumably it 
can be taken out with no harm done.
In my kernel tree, the st5481 source files don't include the lines you 
show.  What source version are you using?
Finally, the URB.txt documentation file clearly states at the beginning 
that it is out of date.  However it wouldn't hurt to fix it up a little.  
I'll send in a patch to do so.
