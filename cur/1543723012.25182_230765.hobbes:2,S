Subject: make foo/bar.o fails in untouched kernel trees

Sam, this should be something for you.
tar xvjf linux-2.6.7.tar.bz2
cd linux-2.6.7
cp /boot/config-2.6.6 .config
make oldconfig
make drivers/ide/ide.o
The above didn't work for me, as the symlink from asm-ARCH to asm was
still missing.  Is there a simple fix for this?

When in doubt, punt.  When somebody actually complains, go back and fix it...
The 90% solution is a good thing.
