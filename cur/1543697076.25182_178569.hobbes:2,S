Both SMP kernels (2.4 and 2.6) appear to have the same interrupt map 
(cat /proc/interrupts):

When I boot X under kernel 2.6, I see the additional nvidia interrupt 
path as per the 2.4 output (which was taken whilst I was running X).
But, within seconds of this additional interrupt assignment appearing, 
2.6 dies a horrible death whilst 2.4 just keeps on rolling.
Cheers,
Dan.
