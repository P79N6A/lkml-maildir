Well, I don't like either, hehe.  But, partition IDs are the only
thing I'm talking about here (the other was merely drive-by flaming)

Why is this necessary?  Can't the RAID drivers probe the device for
signatures, the same way file systems do?
(BTW: LVM does this too, and linux-ppc uses partition types as
heuristics
for finding the root device, IIRC, and lots of other boring stuff.  But,
I suspect it isn't needed)

Exactly.  So, for new disk labels, or whatever, we should recommend to
the relevant hackers that we have exactly one number for Linux.  Or
what?

Exactly.
