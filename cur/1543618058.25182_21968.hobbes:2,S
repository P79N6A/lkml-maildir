Anton is correct, his the first person to ever sit down and do a peer
review of the code otherwise it would have been found earlier.
The code is correct, but how it interfaces to the kernel is dead wrong,
with the exclusion of DMA.
Data should not be damaged, since a simple pio mount would deadlock cold,
or even faster earlier deadlock would happen durning partition checking,
long before.
The full disclosure is one line was stubbed out/ changed to an undef,
thus disk io was not running PIO taskfile, a simple one line change made
things appear one way and not as reality suggested.
For the most part, the patch cleans up all the other automatic services.
This stablized some minor issues but to specifics are not fully chased and
documented.
It comes down to one thing, I got to deep in the hardware to make it run
perfect and clean and forgot how to make it interface to the kernel.
