Indeed.  Linus, please consider merging at least George's latest patch
set which provides just the new system calls to support POSIX clocks and
timers.  There is no dependence on the high-resolution bits, so at least
Linux can provide the missing POSIX.4 system calls.
George can then provide the high resolution code separately which can be
debated and optionally merged.
