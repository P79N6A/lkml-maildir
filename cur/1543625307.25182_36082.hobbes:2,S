Yes.  This resulted in a very nasty ABI change, since in effect
RLIM_INFINITY changed on us.  It's rather embarassing, actually, since
this is the sort of thing that I generally complain about happening
with various user-land libraries (such as glibc, ncurses, libgal,
etc.) and I used to say that kernel programmers were generally a lot
more careful about such things.  Well, I can't say that any more....

I did this because I was tired of bug reports from users who were
losing due to other programs that were attempting to set the limit of
RLIMIT_FSIZE, and screwing up because they were compiled with 2.2
headers.  (Or rather, were compiled with a glibc which was compiled
against 2.2 headers.)n

Unfortunately, all of my testing was done under systems where the
glibc was already compiled under 2.4 headers, so I didn't realize that
glibc would try to be "helpful" and correct the limit used by rlimit.
(In other words, the e2fsprogs workaround was only worked in the case
where other programs were losing because they were using the 2.2
kernel ABI, but the libc was using the 2.4 kernel ABI.  Sigh.)
So obviously, the way I need to fix e2fsprogs is to fork a child
process, check to see whether or not I can safely call setrlimit, and
if not, exit without trying to set it.  :-( This is a really dirty
hack, but I don't see any other way fixing user-land programs that are
trying to work around this ABI mess.  (And since distributions are
already shipping 2.4 kernels, this is a mess that userspace programs
are going to have to deal with for a non-trivial amount of time.)

I think we should do (b) as soon as possible, but it'll still be a
program since most distributions are either shipping CD-ROM's with 2.4
kernels on them already (sigh).
The other fix is that the filesize limit *really* shouldn't apply to
block devices.  We should probably do both fixes.
