Poll is not supported right now because I didn't know how to do
it and I didn't have time to investigate (this was a quickie 
hack). Same thing w/ UNIX domain socket - also I wanted to avoid
sockets because I considered it could be done with simple reads
(thus, if for whatever reason you don't compile sockets, you
don't need to make it more complex - this is also the reason
to force reading whole messages and having the length in the
header - it's a poor's man rcvmsg()).
Partial reads are what really complicates the stuff - I didn't see
a point in supporting them because events are supposed to be kind
of limited in size, not a huge thing; I don't think there are too
many cases where you provide a buffer smaller than say, 256 bytes.
And then, providing small buffers is also kind of underperforming;
you want to maximize how much events you get in a single shot per
system call, to minimize the system call overhead - that means a
bigger buffer; your granularity in time is what will determine it.

And the event struct is generic enough. That's why the data[] thing is
there - you include the message format you want: ascii, binary, name it.
What gets propagate to user space is a four byte size and then
the stuff you asked to have delivered. How can it be more generic
on the format realm?

This would not be difficult to do - however, I see a little bit
overkill to have a filesystem for it when the files could be
plugged into, for example /sysfs [add to my stuff a declare message
queue, and export it in /sysfs as a file] - Will look into that
ASAP.
