I agree that this is where it belongs, but it is hard to do that in a
POSIX compliant way.  It also becomes hard to timestamp things in
filesystems using UTC rather than TAI.  There are other protocols that
deal with UTC times as well.

Agreed.  That's the whole crux of the 'multiple time scales suck'
threads that I've talked about in other forums.  You have to know this
information before you start, have to deal with 'dusty system' problem
for systems that have been off for 6 months or not upgraded.  You also
have to cope with learning after the fact that your initial guess was
wrong.
I've had many systems that would get this information from GPS and
stall the rest of the system until this data came in.  I did this
mostly because there were big issues with the software down stream if
you changed the delta between your putative UTC and TAI after the
fact.

I've wanted this for a long time...

Yes.  The kernel would need to be able to return both UTC and TAI
times to the kernel as well, since there are requirements for NFS to
return timestamps in UTC, not in TAI.  Many file systems specify UTC
time, or have traditionally been implemented that way.
