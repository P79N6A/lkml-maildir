Hi Adolfo,
this is really weird, that the keys do not produce any debugging output at 
all. Do you think you could use usbmon to see what data is coming from 
they keyboard through USB bus? Details are explained at 
Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt.

From the debugging output, it seems that the HID report arrives, but all 
bits are set to zero, which is also strange. Could you please also capture 
usbmon output for this event? It could be that the HID report descriptor 
of this device is wrong, and the report is in fact longer than two bytes.

The keyboard is buggy and doesn't handle "Power" as a button for which 
EV_REP should be set. This will be trivial to fix by keyboard-specific 
quirk, I will send it to you together with other changes, when we collect 
any interesting information from usbmon.
Thanks for great and detailed bugreport,
