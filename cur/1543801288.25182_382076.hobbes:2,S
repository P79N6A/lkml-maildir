You missed one:
5 - They've implemented Yet Another IEEE802.11 stack instead of
embracing and extending the Intel one we already have, and are hence
urinating into the atmospheric disturbance.
That's one of the reasons why I merged bcm43xx and softmac into the
Fedora kernel and none of the others, FWIW -- Johannes is actually
working on improving what we have in the kernel, rather than just saying
"You have to throw it all away because $MYSTACK is better". So I figure
softmac has a _much_ better chance of going upstream, even if its
feature list isn't quite as comprehensive yet.
