 Since the main argument against capability metadata was nfs, and immutable
isn't exported over NFS, why not just make up a new Ext2 attribute for "check
capabilities"?  This would also stop any weirdness for someone who happened to
set +ti for another reason.   But anyway, how do other unix's which implement
capabilities do it? or are there even any other unixes which implement it?
