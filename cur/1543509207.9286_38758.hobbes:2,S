Actually, there should be no ordering restrictions for initializing
the basic PCMCIA components, versus initializing client drivers.  The
init routines for clients just register event callbacks, and this can
happen before sockets are enumerated or initialized.
The only real restriction I can think of is that the 'ds' module
should be initialized after all non-PCMCIA drivers that might be used
for PCMCIA devices (i.e., serial, ide, etc).
