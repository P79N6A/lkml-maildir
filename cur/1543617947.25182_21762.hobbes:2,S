Subject: Would anyone be willing to host a second kernel.org site?

The recent troubles we've had at kernel.org pretty much highlight the
issues with having an offsite system with no easy physical access.
This begs the question if we could establish another primary
kernel.org site; this would not only reduce the load on any one site
but deal with any one failure in a much more graceful way.
Anyone have any ideas of some organization who would be willing to
host a second kernel.org server?  Such an organization should expect
around 25 Mbit/s sustained traffic, and up to 40-100 Mbit/s peak
traffic (this one can be adjusted to fit the available resources.)
If so, please contact me...
