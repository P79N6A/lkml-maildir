Look at the patch, that's what it does. For ide dma, it's all or
nothing. So if it times out, no part of the request is ended
ide_dma_timeout_retry does the sanity re-setup of the request for good
measure, and it might be needed in the future when ide dma can do
partial requests (2.5, not now). The request _is_ reissued from scratch.

This is bull shit. If IDE didn't muck around with the request so much in
the first place, the info could always be trusted. Even so, we have the
hard_* numbers to go by. So this argument does not hold.

Again, look at the patch. The request is never off the list, so there is
never a reason to reinsert. hwgroup->busy is cleared (and, again for
good measure, hwgroup->rq), so ide_do_request/start_request will get the
same request that we just handled.

Yep
