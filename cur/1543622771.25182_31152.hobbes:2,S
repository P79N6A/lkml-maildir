No, lock_kernel happens after exit_mm, and in fact I suspect it's not
really needed at all any more except for the current "sem_exit()". I
think most everything else is threaded already.
(Hmm.. Maybe disassociate_ctty() too).
So minimizing the BLK footprint in do_exit() should be pretty much
trivial: all the really interesting stuff should be ok already.
