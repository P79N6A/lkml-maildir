Agree with Peter and Hugh here. Also I have a use case where I need to share
DMA buffers between two or more devices. So I think we need a generic DMA
device that does operations like alloc, mmap, etc. Mmapped regions can then be
used with UIO devices.
I'll put together a prototype of that some time early next year.
