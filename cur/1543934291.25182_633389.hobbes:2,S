From: Andrew Murray <amurray@mpc-data.co.uk>
This patch provides a correct value for CONFIG_SH_PCLK_FREQ for the SH7712 solution engine when used with the board's default factory settings. This results in the board running at its maximum CPU clock rate (200 MHz).
The board I have is a Japanese Solution Engine with a 66 MHz (extal) crystal. Is this the only variant of the Solution Engine for the SH7712?
