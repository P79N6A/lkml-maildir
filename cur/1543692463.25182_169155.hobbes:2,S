I'd guess since the majority of the time bit1 and bit2 are compile time 
constants and the comparison can be resolved during compilation into more 
effective code in the bit1==bit2 case, thus effectively decreasing not 
increasing the amount of generated object code.
That probably also explains why the convoluted long code with division
above is faster - the division and multiplication most likely gets
resolved during compile (since we're dealing with compile time constants)
into a single shift and results in an execution of bitop 'and' followed by
'shift left/right', which due to lacking and conditional branches
(necessary for ?:) is usually significantly faster due to a lack of 
branch mispredictions.
