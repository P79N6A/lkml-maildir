fsync on ext2 only really guarantees that the data has reached
the disk, what the disk does it outside the realm of the fs.
If the ide drive has write back caching enabled, the data just
might only be in cache. If the power is removed right after fsync
returns, the drive might not get a chance to actually commit the
write to platter.
This isn't a patch suitable for inclusion, but you could try
and repeat with it applied. Does it fix the file corruption for
you?
