That will just break. The reason for the "compiler.h" include is the 
"__user" part of fpstate, so now you'll get a parse error later if 
non-kernel code includes this.
So the rule should still be: don't include kernel headers from user 
programs. But if it's needed for some reason, that #ifdef needs to be 
somewhere else (inside "compiler.h" or something).
