I know this has been mentioned before, or at least I *hope* it has.
ext2 and ext3 are essentially the same, aren't they?  I'm looking at a
diff, and other than ext2->ext3, I'm seeing things like:
- -              mark_inode_dirty(inode);
+              ext3_mark_inode_dirty(handle, inode);
and thinking
- -              mark_inode_dirty(inode);
+#ifdef CONFIG_EXT2_JOURNALED
+              if (fs->journaled)
+                 extjnl_mark_inode_dirty(handle, inode);
+              else
+#endif
+                 mark_inode_dirty(inode);
would have been so much more appropriate.  I see entire functions that
are dropped and added; the dropped can stay, the added can be added,
they can be used conditionally.  I also see mostly code that just was
copied verbatim, or was s/EXT2/EXT3/ or s/ext2/ext3/ .  That's just not
appropriate.
The ext2 driver can even load up ext3 partitions without using the
journal, if it still behaves like it did in 2.4.20.  I say collapse them
in on eachother.
