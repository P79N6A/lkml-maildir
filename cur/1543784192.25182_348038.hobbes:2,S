That's a different issue.  The current code works if you boot a NUMA=y
SPARSEMEM=y machine with a single node.  The current Kconfig options
also enforce that SPARSEMEM depends on NUMA on i386.
Magnus would like to enable SPARSEMEM=y while CONFIG_NUMA=n.  That
requires some Kconfig changes, as well as an extra memory present call.
I'm questioning why we need to do that when we could never do
DISCONTIG=y while NUMA=n on i386.
