Sorry, if someone asks this before but do you think that you get some stuff 
out of it for 2.4.xx?
Your numbers for the 8 SMP system are great.
Can't wait to do some tests on my poor single 1 GHz Athlon II and soon dual 
Athlon MP/XP 1600+ on an MS 6501 (AMD 760MPX).
Maybe my MP3/Ogg-Vorbis hiccup during dbench 32+ are solved?
Currently running latest 2.4.17+preempt (do think that can be mixed with your 
new scheduler?).
Thanks,
	Dieter
