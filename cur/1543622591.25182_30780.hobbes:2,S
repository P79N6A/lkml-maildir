That's a logging filesystem.  One that stores the "diff" whenever someone
writes, rm's, truncates, etc. etc.
AFAIK they exist, so it can be done.  Don't know much else about them though.
It does seem like the "elegant" solution to the problem though, if it's ~0%
data loss that's the objective.  Having undelete is far from a full solution
to that problem.
Anyone knows about those devils ?
