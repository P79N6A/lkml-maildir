The 'nfsv2' patches contain a snapshot of the latest patches from the
LinuxNFS CVS server on Sourceforge. I've been putting them up on my
site too, since I got requests from people who'd like to test the
Sourceforge patches, but who wouldn't like to go through the entire
CVS machinery of logging in, checking out kernels,...
The name of the patch is linux-bla-nfsv2-date-v3-version, since that
is the convention for labels on Sourceforge. The 'v2' refers to HJ's
nfsd patches, and the v3 is, of course, the NFSv3 client patches.
Cheers,
  Trond
