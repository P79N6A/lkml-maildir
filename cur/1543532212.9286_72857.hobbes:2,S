   ifconfig and route still work on 2.2/2.3 kernels, but these kernels
no longer have interface aliases -- they have just interfaces with multiple
IP addresses attached to them, which has a bit different semantics and the
emulation of the old aliases in the kernel is not perfect.

   Modulo interface alises, I guess.
