Besides the fact that the vmware module just creates a hole in
the kernel security that vmware can climb in, and do whatever it pleases?
I have heard of other instances of vmware cause clock ticks to be missed.
I admit vmware rubs me the the wrong way.  But unless you can reproduce
this without vmware, running it's probably not a kernel bug.
