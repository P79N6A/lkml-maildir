Hey John, please change your disk, it's scratched and you're repeating
yourself again and again. At first I thought "Oh cool, some good news
about reiser4", now when I see "reiserfs" in a thread, I think "oh no,
not this boring guy who escaped from the asylum again !". I hope this
thread will be cut shortly so that you stop doing bad publicity to
reiserfs and its developers, because when a product is indicated as
good by stupid people, it's really doing harm.
Also, about this part :

I don't 100% agree with Jan, because for some usages (temporary space),
light compression can increase speed. For instance, when processing logs,
I get better speed by compressing intermediate files with LZO on the fly.

But what you write here is complete crap. The filesystem relies on a
linear block device. The operating system is responsible for doing
read retries or reporting errors on bad blocks, but the FS and only
the FS can decide how not to use some known defective areas, for
instance not putting any metadata on them nor any useful data.
Now if you want to stop writing stupid things again and again, take
your bag, don't miss the bus to school, and listen to the teachers
instead of playing games on your calculator.

PS: non need to reply either, I'll kill this thread and your address here.
