> shared pagetables
> large page support
Im not sure the complexity of shared pagetables is worth it. On ppc64
it will be a real pain to support since we rely on a 1:1 mapping between
linux and ppc64 ptes.
Unless its a large gain over using large pages (I doubt that will be the
case on sane chips with large TLBs) or conditional per architecture then
I think we should avoid it.
I do think we should get large page support in ASAP.
