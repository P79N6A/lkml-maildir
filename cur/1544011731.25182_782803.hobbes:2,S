Nope, the buffer_size is part of the ftrace API. It was just that it 
seemed that Ingo was pushing that the ring buffer API should handle it. I 
may have misunderstood Ingo though. Note, when Ingo and I start going back 
and forth, we sometimes are at the implementation level, and probably will 
confuse the users ;-)
Since the buffer_size is at the ftrace level, it will make it easier to do 
the changes there.

Exactly.

Correct, and that is what you are doing.

The "buffer_size" file is part of ftrace, not the ring buffer. You are 
making perfect sense.
