What happens if you never load ibm-acpi?
I'm a bit puzzled as CONFIG_FB_BACKLIGHT doesn't do anything with the
intelfb driver. One thing it does do is set
CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE. When you disabled FB_BACKLIGHT and got a
working display on resume, was that set and was (or had) ibm-acpi been
loaded?
A variety of other options such as ACPI_IBM also set
CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE although without a backlight driver it
will do nothing hence the suspicion is on ibm-acpi, perhaps interacting
with the backlight class badly.
Does echoing numbers to /sys/class/backlight/ibm_acpi/brightness change
the backlight brightness as expected? If you can ssh into the machine
after its resumed with the display problem, it would be interesting to
know what the brightness was and if changing it helped too...

Richard
