actually (talking to myself?) there is a good reason not to do so.
Performance. So, my statement should be slightly changed to "All calls to
system calls (except where impossible, e.g. fork()/pause() should go
through sys_XXX() functions"
E.g. exec_modprobe() of kernel/kmod.c calls inlined close(i) while it
could just do sys_close(i).

Tigran.
