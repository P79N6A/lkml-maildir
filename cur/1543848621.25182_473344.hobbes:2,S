The stack traces look fine without unwind, and at a glance looked fine
with unwind as well, so I speculate you must be using save_stack_trace
properly.  The only difference I noticed was the incredible speed
difference.  I gave up on getting to run level 5 with unwind, getting to
level 2 took ages, and the box was horribly slow at everything.
