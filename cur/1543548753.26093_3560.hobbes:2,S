Entirely?  That's interesting, because for our consistency requirements we
only need the data cache to be flushed for a particular inode at the time
of a locking call.  At least if we port to Solaris (hah!) we won't have
this particular problem in our clients.

That would be very welcome, but it's doubtful we could get an nfsv4 server
to run on our old bsdi 1.x-based servers :)  
Thank you very much for continuing to pursue this.  I wish I were an NFS
expert, but as I may have said elsewhere, this task falls to me as the
Linux evangelist at the office.
