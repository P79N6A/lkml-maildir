There's generally a bit of overlap. 2.6.17.14 was about the same time as 
2.6.18.1, and 2.6.18.6 was after 2.6.19.1. But 2.6.18.x must be over now, 
because the -stable team didn't release a 2.6.18.7 to match 2.6.19.2, and 
all of 2.6.x except for 2.6.19.2 has that weird file corruption bug 
(although rarely triggered).
