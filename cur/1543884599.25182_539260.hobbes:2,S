Just did.  Still hangs same way; strace shows /sbin/hwclock dying after 
hundreds of RTC_RD_TIME.  And now /proc/interrupts shows no rtc 
interrupts being generated (expected, I gues).  Seems to take longer to 
crash, but this is a heisenbug.
Enough crashing for today.  Strangest thing is the NMI watchdog does not 
fire...
