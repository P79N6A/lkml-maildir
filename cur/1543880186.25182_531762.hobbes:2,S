We are certainly much more complex then the code in plan9 (just
read through it) so I think we have room for improvement.
Just for reference what I saw in plan 9 was:
- No super user checks in it's mount, unmount, or namespace creation paths.
- A flag to deny new mounts but not new bind mounts (for administrative purposes
  the comment said).
Our differences from plan9.
- suid capable binaries. (SUID please go away).
- A history of programs assuming only root could call mount/unmount.

The practical question is how do we limit what a user can mount and
unmount.
I would contend that at first glance stuffing a user in their own
mount namespace is sufficient, on a system with utilities aware
of the consequences of mount/unmount.
So we may not need a unprivileged mount disable except as a way
to allow an old user space to run a new kernel.

After user space has been updated we always want to allow unprivileged
mounts. 
If I get pushed I will say that we need to remove suid exec capability
from user space as well.  At which point we don't even need directory
security checks, there is enough benefit there I certainly think
it is worth considering having an entire NOSUID user space.
Removing suid is probably excessive but if it isn't much harder
then sane mount namespace support we should probably consider it.

Ok.  I just looked at what user space is doing.  The difference is that
what user space is doing predates mount namespaces, and was there as
far as I can tell to keep one user from causing problems for
another user.   If we choose to make mount namespaces to be
the unit of granularity we don't need this capability.
All we have to do is deny unmounts that would confuse a suid
executable.  Which mounts are those?
