Yes, but it's looking at devices it should _not_ care about.  The USB
core should only care about devices it controls, not other devices in
the device chain.  Those are for the driver core to handle.

Ah, ok, I thought it was somewhere...  David, why don't we walk that
list instead?

No, if it's not there, just expect that it knows what it is doing, and
don't fail the thing.  Unless you want to add those methods to _every_
driver in the kernel, and that's going to be a lot of work...

It's a virtual device, it can go to sleep just fine with nothing needed
to have done at all, as it's just in kernel memory, no physical thing to
turn to "low power" mode at all.
