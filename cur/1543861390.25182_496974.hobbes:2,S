Hi,
I'm pleased to announce the release of Squashfs 3.2.  NFS exporting  
is now supported, and the kernel code has been hardened against  
accidently or maliciously corrupted filesystems.  The new release  
correctly handles all corrupted filesystems generated by the fsfuzzer  
tool (written by LMH/Steve Grubb) without oopsing the kernel.  This  
in particular fixes the MOKB (Month of Kernel Bugs) report raised  
against Squashfs.
Squashfs can be dowloaded from 
http://squashfs.sourceforge.net
. The  
full list of changes  are:
Improvements:
         1. Squashfs filesystems can now be exported via NFS.
         2. Unsquashfs now supports 2.x filesystems.
         3. Mksquashfs now displays a progress bar.
         4. Squashfs kernel code has been hardened against accidently or
             maliciously corrupted Squashfs filesystems.
Bug fixes:
        5. Race condition occurring on S390 in readpage() fixed.
        6. Odd behaviour of MIPS memcpy in read_data() routine worked- 
around.
        7. Missing cache_flush in Squashfs symlink_readpage() added.
