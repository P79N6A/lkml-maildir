I'm convinced that the right fix is to just make everybody have plugging
functions.
Right now, who doesn't? The fix is unbelievably ugly, AND can break real
drivers that _do_ have plugging functions (where they get surprised by
having their request function called several times per plug just because 
somebody unplugged them and new requests came in).
Just fix ndb instead.
