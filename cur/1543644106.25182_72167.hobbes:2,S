To quote Ulrich:
"Even on IA-32 with its limited address space and memory handling
 running 100,000 concurrent threads was no problem at all, creating
 and destroying the threads did not take more than two seconds."
It clearly states 100,000 CONCURRENT threads. So, it really seems to
work (not that I have the hardware to verify this claim).
