"Always be the second operating system port to an undocumented platform.
The sterling work done by the OpenBSD/Mac team was a huge help to the
Linux project. I'm also happy to say that while half of the world may
sit on usenet advocacy groups throwing manure the relationship between
the Linux and BSD Macintosh teams has always been one of mutual
co-operation. Together we advance our detective work and knowledge of
the Macintosh platforms to the good of all Macintosh users dumped"
Alan Cox circa 1999.

"well I'd be quite happy to see X go GPL but I'm aware
thats not the intention of the project ;)"
Alan Cox circa 2007.
What changed? Why are you guys setting out to break all of the
work underpinning UNIX and the Internet done in the 80s at
Berkeley? The reason the protocols and infrastructure took
off in the first place is due to liberal licenses that let everyone
be involved, not wrapping things up in more restrictions and lawyers.
