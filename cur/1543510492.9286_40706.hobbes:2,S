I added small modifications a while back to 2.2.3 to use this, with a
packet engines gigE card.  The driver sets a bit in the dev structure
saying it knows how to do tx checksum, then the IP output path notices
and does only the pseudo header.  Hardware adds in the packet body
checksum.
The impact on bandwidth was, however, minimal.  At least for 500 MHz
alpha machines.  Perhaps somebody with a slower machine will be happier
with the percentage improvements.
