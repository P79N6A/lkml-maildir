Subject: autoload scsi1 on access of /dev/sdc1

I have a puzzle. I have a PD drive that I have attached to a second
SCSI controller (AHA2930) and I configured the aic7xxx driver as a
module. The disk in question appears as /dev/sdc.
I set up an alias for scsi1, so "modprobe scsi1" does the right thing
for me. However, what I would really like is for any attempt to mount
/dev/sdc1 to autoload the aic7xxx module. After all, I only need it
overnight, when dumps happen.
The sd driver is *not* a module, and my main hard drives are on the
Intraserver card, which is also not a module. It is just the aic7xxx
module that I only need periodically, and I would like to only load
when I need the third disk.
This may not be possible, but hints are welcome.
