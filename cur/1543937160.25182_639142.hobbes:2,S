a binary wouldnt work for me anyway. But you could try to write a 
"workload simulator": just pick out the pthread ops and replace the 
worker functions with some dummy stuff that just touches an array that 
has similar size to the tiles (in a tight loop). Make sure it has 
similar context-switch rate and idle percentage as your real workload - 
then send us the .c file. As long as it's a single .c file that runs for 
a few seconds and outputs a precise enough "run time" result, kernel 
developers would pick it up and use it for optimizations. To get the # 
of cpus automatically you can do:
        cpus = system("exit `grep processor /proc/cpuinfo  | wc -l`");
        cpus = WEXITSTATUS(cpus);
and start as many threads as many CPUs there are in the system.
