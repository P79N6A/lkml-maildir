Hi,
Here are some PCI and PCI hotplug patches for 2.6.2-rc2.
There's a few misc pci patches in here for different platforms (mips and
ppc64) and a few pci hotplug bug fixes.  There's also a big pci.ids
update that is the majority of the patch.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.6
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
