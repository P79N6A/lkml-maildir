That's true for IDE, definitely, but for other drive technologies the 
information can be ether inadequate or downright misleading... 
especially when dealing with complex disk topologies.  Worse, as one 
could expect, the information provided is downright wrong in many cases.
To make matters worse, the EDD standard doesn't have a maintainer, so 
new technologies aren't assigned new identifier.
What you'd want is a way to query the disk serial number, but EDD 
doesn't provide that (there is the "packet interface", but it doesn't 
seem to be widely implemented.)
