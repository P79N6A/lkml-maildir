I'd interpret "initiated" as having reached hardware.  "Queued for
service" is much more open to interpretation: Uli came up with "the data
must be actively put in a stage where I/O is initiated", which still
doesn't really address what sort of queueing is allowed.

Sure.  There are lots of ways an interface can be misused, though: you
only know if one use is valid or not once you've determined what the
_correct_ use is.  I'm much more concerned about getting a correct
interpretation of the spec than of making IO fast for the sake of a
memory benchmark. :-)

Agreed.

Well, this whole issue came up precisely because somebody was seeing
exactly such a latency hit going from 2.4.9 to a later kernel.  We've
not really been consistent about it in the past.

Exactly why we need documentation for that combination, whatever
happens.

Just for the reason you mentioned --- a real-world app (in-house, so
flags==0 is actually a valid solution for them) which was seeing
performance degradation when the "MS_ASYNC submits IO" was introduced in
the first place.  But it was internally written, so I've no idea at all
whether or not the app was assuming one behaviour or the other on other
Unixen.
