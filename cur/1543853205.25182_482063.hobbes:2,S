It's out of scope in the sense that it doesn't say "here's how to do it".
But it's in-scope in that what it _does_ say makes sure it can be done;
the example implementation does it.

So?  You're still confusing GPIOs with pins/balls.  They're quite distinct,
in the general case, though maybe not on SH?
Some balls can be used for multiple GPIOs, some GPIOs can be mapped to one
of several balls... there's no general way to infer mux data from knowing
what GPIOs are needed.

Well, especially since it will be platform-specific, it can't really
be part of the GPIO framework.  I'll repeat the example of OMAP1,
which lets some GPIOs come out on multiple pins ... pin configuration
and GPIOs really **must** be orthogonal.  There is just no way to
infer the right mux setup even given a complete list of GPIOS that
will be used.  Ditto pullup/pulldown config, multi-drive options,
and so forth.
But it's straightforward to talk about "use <this GPIO> as an input",
and "set <this output GPIO> to high".  That doesn't require any
knowledge of how the pins are configured, and is a model that works
with every GPIO controller ever built.

Maybe.  I'm looking at the type of clearly defined system for which
Linux has good support:  one board, or a standard board stack; or
sometimes there's PCI-ish autoconfiguration on an expansion bus.

Sure, but that's exactly what I've been saying and isn't in conflict with it.

See above; if the system is clearly defined, it _can_ be resolved then.
Or at worst, by some platform-specific autoconfiguration scheme.

You're bringing in a new problem though:  autoconfiguring a board stack.
The classic approach is to formalize the module bus and teach that bus how
to enumerate according to the "hotplug" model (like PCI, PNP, etc) ... for
example, consulting an I2C EEPROM with board IDs, with the EEPROM address
depending on which slot it's plugged in to.  At the moment you know what
boards are connected, surely you know how to mux those pins ... and what
devices to register, etc.
That's another set of problems that's nicely distinct from GPIOs.  :)
