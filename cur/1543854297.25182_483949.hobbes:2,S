Which is what I meant... "implicit by reading the vector".

Which you can do on OpenPIC too. It's the same idea. The concept that
obtaining the vector performs the ack.

Ok, so why would you need an ack there then while eoi is just what you
need ? :-)
Also, that's interesting what you are saying about 8259... I should be
able to convert ppc's i8259 to use fasteoi too...
