Easy. O_NONBLOCK should only affect whether read/write blocks or
returns EAGAIN. It's logical for this setting to be per-process.
Currently changing O_NONBLOCK on stdin/out/err affects other,
possibly unrelated processes - they don't expect that *their*
reads/writes will start returning EAGAIN!
Worse, it cannot be worked around by dup() because duped fds
are still sharing O_NONBLOCK. How can I work around this?
