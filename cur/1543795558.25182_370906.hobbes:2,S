I disagree with you David. It's been years since I last compiled a
kernel as root, and even longer without untarring it as root ! I have
/usr/src chmod g+w for group "linux" to which I belong. I untar new
kernels there, compile them, etc... as my own user. Then I only do:
  $ sudo make modules_install
  $ sudo cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage System.map .config /boot/<version>
  $ sudo vi /etc/lilo.conf
  $ sudo lilo
And it brings me real advantages : during all the compilation phase,
I can use everything I have in *my* environment, aliases, functions,
scripts, tools, etc... that I would not necessarily have as root.
Believe me, for no reason I would switch back to the old age when
I did all this as root !

Willy
