I for one prefer the standard VT100 yellow instead of brown, and I
have an escape sequence to do that similar to the one you show above.
However, there's one major flaw - programs recently (and by that I mean
FC2-like recently) have started to do complete console resets, which
result in the users settings being completely wiped out.
For instance, I have:
if [ "$TERM" = "linux" ]; then
  echo -ne '\e]P3aaaa00'
fi
in the bash login scripts.  Run mutt 1.4 and that gets wiped out.
Previous version of mutt (1.2?) didn't do this.
So, in essence, this is a completely useless solution.  I think we need
a separate escape sequence to modify the system default so that peoples
preferences do not get inadvertently wiped out by programs.
(I have also considered writing a module to locate the default palette
and "correct" it.)
