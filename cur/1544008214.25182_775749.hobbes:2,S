sys_rt_sigqueueinfo disallows setting si_code to any value which
describes kernel signals from userspace. So using SI_FROMUSER should be
sufficient.

Where does this imply checking sender for kernel generated signals?

Please add a complete comment to the function which describes the
function. And don't us "it" for not defined entities.
