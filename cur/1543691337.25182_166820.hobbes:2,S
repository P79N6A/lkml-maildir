Before running too far in this direction I would suggest to solve Oliviers'
problem with the aic driver. I really would like to know if he sees the same
positive effects in pre4 like me. It seems Andreas' vm patches have a very
positive influence on the issue. At least I cannot see the "crawling effect" up
to now with 6GB and pre4 compared to 2.4.22. It would surely be of interest
if Oliviers' 8 GB variant improves, too.
May well be that the bouncing is not that bad compared to other corner effects
of the vm in this special situation.
Interactivity during load and especially network seems far better in pre4. For
sure it is not as speedy as a 4GB setup, but it works pretty well (up to now).
Regards,
Stephan
