Having suffered through this "Daddy, why did you break the computer?".
I can say that fixboot/fixmbr will not work. 
What did work on my machine was changing the BIOS setting on the boot disk
from "Auto" to "Large disk".  As I remember there were several possible settings
and it took trying all of them till one worked. Still not sure why it worked
though.
