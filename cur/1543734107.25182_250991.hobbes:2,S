I have no problem with 8K interrupt stacks - they're static, and per CPU,
so I doubt anyone cares ... 
But 8K task stacks + interrupt stacks seems to just encourage bloat to me.
And if you agree that we're going to 4K, I don't really see the point - 
if people are really hitting problems (I don't recall any actual reports)
then I'd prefer to see them fixed properly by poking the fat bloater with
a big pin.
