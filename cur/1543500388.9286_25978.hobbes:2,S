I just had a 2.2.5-ac6 box start spitting messages like these:
Jun 24 04:04:31 blackhole kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device 
Jun 24 04:04:31 blackhole kernel: 03:05: rw=0, want=1879843524,
limit=4200966 
Jun 24 04:04:31 blackhole kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device 
Jun 24 04:04:31 blackhole kernel: 03:05: rw=0, want=1879844446,
limit=4200966 
There were no other messages before this that were odd in any way.  The
machine has been rebooted -- the filesystems were clean after a reboot.
The .config is attached -- short version: no quotas, scsi, IRdA, etc.  
The hardware is an AMD K6-2/400, 64MB of (tested good) PC100 RAM, Asus
socket-7 mobo (not sure of exact model, but it's got the Aladdin IV
chipset), 3c905B.  
No NFS server or clients running, nor portmap.  The only daemons
listening on the box are syslogd and sshd ;)
If any more information is needed, just ask.
Josh
