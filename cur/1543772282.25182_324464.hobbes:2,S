But you already _have_ the option to associate. Just issue
appropriate iwconfig command (or embed one in startup script).

Do we have to add such option to each and every wireless driver now?
That would be wrong since iwconfig already exists.

User. As I said, with no automatic assoc at module load user still
may easily attain that with iwconfig.
Adding kernel level wireless autoconfiguration duplicates the effort.
Since I am not going to give up a requirement to be able to stay radio
silent at boot (me too wants freedom, not only you), you need to add
disable=1 module parameter to each driver, which adds to the mess.
ALSA does the Right Thing. Sound is completely muted out at module load.
It's a user freedom to set desired volume level after that.
