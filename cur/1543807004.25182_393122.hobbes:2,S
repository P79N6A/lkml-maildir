Moin!
When I try to compile 2.6.15.2 with ARCH=um and I did before
"make clean" and "make ARCH=um menuconfig", it aborts due to
this error:
include/linux/jiffies.h:39:7: warning: "CONFIG_HZ" is not defined
include/linux/jiffies.h:42:3: error: #error You lose.
This repeats many many times.
What information do you need? (Please cc-me on reply no nico-kernel2@...)
