Yeah, unfortunately, "should not" doesn't mean "does not" in this case.  
In cases where we can't control the firmware, we have to use it to 
control the backlight exclusively, or we'll definitely get into 
trouble.

So is this really the direction that input is going?  Last time I talked 
with Dmitry, he seemed ok with adding input events for ACPI and other 
firmware hotkeys...

Yeah, the backlight class needs some changes:  the backlight dirs should 
somehow identify the display they control and only *one* backlight 
driver should be registered for a given display.  Unfortunately we 
don't have enough info in the kernel to identify displays, so those 
changes may have to wait until the DRM grows such knowledge.
