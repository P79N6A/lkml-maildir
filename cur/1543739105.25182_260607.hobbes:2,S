only if compiling for PREEMPT_REALTIME. Given the overhead of
PREEMPT_REALTIME i'm not sure RCU matters that much. But the nicest
would be Dipankar's preemptible-RCU patch.

well, nesting would be one issue. What if such a section gets preempted
on this CPU and another task tries to use the same mutex? 
Per-var-per-cpu mutexes seemed like the most orthogonal extension to the
existing concept. Keeping the original Linux locking semantics intact
seems like the primary mission, at least until the full scope is mapped.
