    The Large Disk HOWTO doesn't cover disks over 8.4Gb (at least not
    last time I checked)
Not so pessimistic. It covered SCSI disks over 8.4Gb since the day
it was written, IDE disks over 8.4Gb since May 1998, and BIOS
translations of IDE disks over 8.4Gb since Dec 1998.
     - please see the following reference for complete info on getting 
    past the 8.4Gb limit on kernels prior to 2.0.37pre4 and 2.2.1 (I think...):
    
http://www-oss.fnal.gov/fss/documentation/linux/linux-faq/
    See both the entries on "how to format disks > 8.4gb" and "Large Disk Drives (>
    8.4Gb)"
Yes. I just looked and the information there is more or less correct
and has the advantage of being very explicit.
Since 2.2.3 the 2.2.* kernels are fine in this respect.
I just checked ftp.linux.org.uk:/pub/linux/alan/2.0.37pre
but that only has 2.0.37-pre-patch-8 in which this stuff
is still somewhat broken.
