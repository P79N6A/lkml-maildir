There is a memory leak in 2.2.12 on the Alpha thats for sure.  My system
eats up all memory in 3 to 6 days.  If you calculate the swap usage from ps
output it is much less after a day vs. the output of 'free', after 3+ days
swap is almost all used up and ps output still calculates near the same
figures that it did when the box was first started.
The system runs near or over 400 processes with a huge load... with linux
it can't live longer than 3 or 4 days..
