The generic block level tagging is nothing more than tag management. It
can 'tag' a request (assigning it an integer tag), and later let you
locate that request by giving it the tag.
I suspect you need none of that for FCP. Instead it looks more like you
can set the task attributes based on the type of request itself. So you
would currently set 'ordered' for a request with REQ_BARRIER set. And
you could set 'head of queue' for REQ_URGENT (I'm making this one up
:-), etc.
Do you need any request management to deal with FCP queueing? It doesn't
sound like it.
