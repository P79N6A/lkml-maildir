Here are the latest results for my elv_test elevator benchmark.
This benchmark gives three numbers, a baseline figure for writing
sequentially and write and read results for writing and reading in a
pattern designed to give the elevator a hard time.
The source code is available at
http://tltsu.anu.edu.au/~robert/elv_test.c.
I was hoping to see some improvements in 2.4.0-test9 based on recent
comments in the linux-kernel mailing list. But I havent seen any
improvement from 2.4.0-test9pre2.
The fundamental problem appears to be that disk writes are being
performed in a inefficient order causing the disk to seek far too often.
For comparisom, Ive done tests with kernel versions going all the way
back to 2.0.39 and discovered a few interesting points.
I will summarise first, full results are at the end.
Kernel 2.0.39 had a relatively slow read elevator (3 Mb/s read).
Kernel 2.2.14 improved on this (6 Mb/s read), but recent 2.2 kernels
(2.2.17+) have a problem with the read performance (back to 3Mb/sec).
Interestingly this doesnt seem to be an elevator problem because it
shows up worse in tiotest (1 Mb/sec read).
Kernel 2.4.0-test1 had quite good read and write elevator performance.
The write elevator dropped in 2.4.0-test3 to 2.5-3 Mb/sec.
And dropped again in 2.4.0-test9pre2 to 1 Mb/sec.
Annoyingly this elevator performance problem doesnt seem to be the only
issue that is effecting the netatalk benchmark that I started this
investigation with. The only kernel I see reasonable netatalk
performance from was 2.4.0-test1-ac22.
So there are several kernels that show reasonable performance in
elv_test which still perform badly in netatalk.
