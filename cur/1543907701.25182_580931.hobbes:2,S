I have not tested elilo. I use another x86_64 EFI boot loader (it will
be released soon), but elilo works in the same way, and I will test
elilo later. The 16bit entry of kernel (arch/(i386|x86_64)/boot/setup.S)
is not used by elilo. Instead, elilo collects the needed information
defined in include/asm-x86_64/bootsetup.h itself, and passes it to
kernel 32bit entry (arch/(i386|x86_64)/boot/compressed/head.S). For E820
map, the elilo converts the EFI memory map to E820 map in "boot
parameters memory" which is copied to "boot_params" or "x86_boot_params"
by Linux kernel later.
>Or did you apply more patches?
No, just the frame buffer patch.
