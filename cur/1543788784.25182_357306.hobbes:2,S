That was what I meant by having the opposite problem here. I think
dumping the stack and returning NULL is okay, as long as all programmers
test its return value, and decide to fail in an alternative way, just
like Anton does, for example. But unfortunately, that's not what happen. 
In a lot of cases, we see uses like these: (This one from affs.h)
	bh = sb_getblk(sb, block);
	lock_buffer(bh);
	memset(bh->b_data, 0 , sb->s_blocksize);
	set_buffer_uptodate(bh);
	unlock_buffer(bh);
Which does not seem to be the right usage for it.
As I said, I took away the checks because I missed that return
statement. I usually don't think that hanging is the preferred solution
in the cases in which you can stop gracefully - But in case you do stop
gracefully, not dereference a NULL pointer.

Maybe the best solution is neither one nor another. Testing and failing
gracefully seems better.
What do you think?
