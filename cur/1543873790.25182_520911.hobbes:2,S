Ok. I started to look at this approach and realized that module.c 
already does this:

However stop_machine_run doesn't seem like the right thing to do, 
because users of the "modules" list don't seem to do anything to prevent 
preemption. Am I missing something?
Does freeze_processes() / unfreeze_processes() solve this by only 
freezing processes that have voluntarily scheduled (opposed to just 
being preempted)?
