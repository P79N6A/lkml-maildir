I am not so sure.  I have a geforce3 ti5, that has been running fine
with nvidia drivers 1.0.4363 (yes, I know they are not supported here).
Thing is, until 2.5.69-bk1/2/3, it have been running fine, and with
bk7/8, I have had X dieing when just scrolling a window in evolution
or galeon.  This is usually if it had been up for a few hours.
Thus, basically with the same drivers/X/whatever, it has been
working fine for day no reboot, but somewhere after bk3 something
is causing it to misbehave.
The mobo is a Asus P4C800 (Intel 875p chipset), with the agp running
in 4x mode.
