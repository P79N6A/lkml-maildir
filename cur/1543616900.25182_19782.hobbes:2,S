Subject: IDE Patches bring amazing performance gain!!!

As a heads up, Andre Hedrick's (Andre sorry for the misspelling 
previously!) IDE patch improved the performance of my 7200rpm ATA100 IBM 
IDE hd from 28Mb/s to 38Mb/s as measured by hdparm -t /dev/hda, which is 
quite an improvement by anyones standards! Also hitting the disk with a lot 
of io maintains low latency and my mp3s aren't dropping out and my X 
session maintains interactivity. (-:
Considering I have seen many good reports and ZERO bad reports about the 
IDE patches it is really astonishing that the patches are not being applied 
to the 2.4.x kernel series... (especially as they were in the -ac series 
previously already)
Best regards,
Anton
