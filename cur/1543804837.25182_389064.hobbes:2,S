First of all, it isn't just the same. I need to know if
memory is locked or not. I need to know the page size.
Second of all, smaps is surely a parody of bad file
format design. When I first heard of the patch, I was
certain that it would be rejected for that reason.
At the time I was to sick and busy to even comment
on the matter. It was with shock and horror that I
later found the patch in the kernel.
I can't just fix smaps now, because that would break
a rotten ABI. Patching it out should work OK though,
because it is recent enough that apps will still support
kernels without it. I would have done so with this patch,
but you supposedly don't care for big patches.
