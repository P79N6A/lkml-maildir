See recent message from me.  All you need is a check "address >=
TASK_SIZE", which is thread already at the start of do_page_fault.  So
if you split that conditional like this, from:
	if (address >= TASK_SIZE && !(error_code & 5))
		goto vmalloc_fault;
	mm = tsk->mm;
	info.si_code = SEGV_MAPERR;
	if (in_atomic() || !mm)
		goto bad_area_nosemaphore;
to:
	if (address >= TASK_SIZE) {
		if (!(error_code & 5))
			goto vmalloc_fault;
		mm = tsk->mm;
		info.si_code = SEGV_MAPERR;
		goto bad_area_nosemaphore;
	}
doesn't that fix the problem and while also being an improvement in
lots of other ways?  The only reason it wouldn't work is if the VMA
list can contain regions >= TASK_SIZE, but I don't think that is done.

I'm looking at "[PATCH] Athlon Prefetch workaround for 2.6.0test6" and
it appears to check the exception table first.  That's why I was
wondering why you have the regs->eip == addr check.
search_exception_table doesn't take any locks for non-module entries,
so it can fixup the __get_user in __is_prefetch when that occurs
inside locked regions of the kernel.
