ouch!
They seem to be quite rare in practice (Barry's was the only one so 
far), but when they happen they can be very nasty. So the lock validator 
creates some gentle pressure to get these fixed ;-) For the really 
really rare cases where the irq enabling is justified (mostly old, very 
slow hardware) it can be easily annotated for lockdep.
