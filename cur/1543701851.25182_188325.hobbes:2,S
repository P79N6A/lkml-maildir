Hi,
 besides wishing everybody a Happy new Year 2004, I have one question.
Have there been any changes in the multicast handling between 2.4.20
and 2.4.22/23? Maybe specific to the "tg3" driver?
 Reason for my question is that the Ganglia monitoring toolkit stopped
working with 2.4.22/23 kernels. Apparently mulicatst get sent, but
nothing is received.
 Any ideas?
Thanks
Martin
