The zImage contain bootsect.o + setup.o + misc.o + piggy.o
piggy.o contain the gzipped vmlinux file in its data section (ELF)
(see compressed/Makefile piggy.o)

Be warn that you can't boot directly a vmlinux file, because it rely on some work made only in boot image
First there is setup.s that create some data in the zero-page (see Documentation/i386/zero-page.txt in the kernel source tree) : hard drive geometry, video mode, memory, PS/2, APM, MCA
After that it switch to protected mode, jump to 0x1000 or 0x10000 (depending on the image type)
Then compressed/head.S initialize stack, SMP , and give control to compressed/misc.c that decompress the kernel and give control to it.
 
PS: all source file mentionned are in arch/i386/boot
