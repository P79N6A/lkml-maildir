Unfortunately this is not strange :(  People have been coding interrupt 
tests into MSI drivers -- shades of the early 90's -- because 
pci_enable_msi() does not fail for systems that do not support MSI. 
-Sometimes- it will fail as expected, if system does not support MSI, 
sometimes not.
For this case -- 32bit non-Intel mobo chipset -- the cause of the 
failure is likely the poor pci_enable_msi() test.
However, I know of at least one MSI-related sata_mv hardware bug that 
needs working around, but that only affects 64-bit.  Given that MSI 
works with this chip on other systems, I'm leaning towards blaming the 
system.
The following are reasonable workarounds:
* Add pci=nomsi kernel parameter... we really need this
* Add 'msi' module option to sata_mv
I'll try to get around to committing the errata to source code. 
Marvell's triple-layered vendor driver is GPL'd, so anyone can steal 
this task from me...
