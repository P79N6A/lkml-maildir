I've not actively tried, but I do have several servers running various
older kernel releases with similar vlan setups and I'm not aware of
any problems with those. Only this new box that I'm using for testing
new kernels (currently) shows the problem, and I've only tried 2.6.8
and 2.6.18-rc5-git2 on the box so far (2.6.8 doesn't have the
problem).
