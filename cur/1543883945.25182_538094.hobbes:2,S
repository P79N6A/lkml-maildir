Well, I've not followed evolutions in this area for a long time. Here's
what I get on my notebook :
willy@wtap:~$ uname -r
2.6.20-wt3-wtap
willy@wtap:~$ ps auxw|grep card   
root      1216  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?        S<   Apr28   0:00 [pccardd]
root      1221  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?        S<   Apr28   0:00 [pccardd]
root      1244  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?        S<   Apr28   0:00 [pccardd]
root      1251  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?        Ss   Apr28   0:00 /sbin/cardmgr
What's the new recommended way of using PCMCIA cards when cardmgr is gone ?
Thanks,
Willy
