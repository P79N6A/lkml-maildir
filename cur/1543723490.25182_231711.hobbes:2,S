Whatever that has to do with, it doesn't really make the fiddling around
going on even noticeable. Hell, I do end-luserish crap too (amazing, I
actually appear to need luserspace to get code written) I've yet to see
a visible change in scheduler behavior in that context across all of
2.4 and 2.5 (and in fact since the earliest Linux kernels I've ever run)
apart from a reduction in cpu time spent in the scheduler itself
associated with (you guessed it) the merge of the incremental epoch
expiry stuff mingo did around early 2.5 (or at least that's the best
description I can come up with the algorithm, as it doesn't resemble any
of the normal algorithms). I suspect widespread placebo effects.

That's an expedient program structure. There is no independence. Those
are examples of things that would have qualified as having been remotely
visible changes and not myriads of infinitesimal intra-queue twiddlings.
No, I don't want to touch scheduling policy (or anything else infested
with such massive quantities of holy penguin pee) with a 10-foot pole.

It means the barrier to entry is very low.

s/been for/before/
I wonder why I've started making homophone errors only in the past 5 years
where beforehand they were very rare. It's not like I started sounding out
words when I read or anything idiotic like that.
