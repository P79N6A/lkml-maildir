Yes, please drop the s390 patch. In general it seems to be better if only
one architecture gets a syscall wired up initially and let other arches
follow later.
Just wondering if the x86_64 compat syscall gets ever fixed? I think
I mentioned already three or four times to Amit that it is broken.
Or is it that nobody cares? Dunno..
In addition there used to be a somewhat inofficial rule that new syscalls
have to come with a test program, so people can easily test if they wired
up the syscall correctly.
