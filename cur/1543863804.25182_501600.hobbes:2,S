Ingo,
You are correct, I only used -hrt.
I will _definitely_ give -rt a try.
I am fully aware that an occasional 100 µs delay is possible, given a
soft real-time operating system. However, what I cannot explain is:
Why do these /occasional/ delays always happen a multiple of 2 seconds
apart? Can you explain this odd behavior?

I will test on a different PC, as John suggested.
I will try the full -rt patchset in a few days.
+++++
On a related note, there is no -hrt patch for 2.6.19:
http://www.tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/
Is it because the patch for 2.6.19-rc4-mm1 applies cleanly to 2.6.19?
There is no -hrt patch for 2.6.20.
Has it been completely merged?
Regards.
