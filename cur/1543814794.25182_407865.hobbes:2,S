Agreed that we shouldn't use -F, but what's the compatibility reason?
Supporting 2**31-1 blocks required bugfixes in the kernel and in
e2fsprogs, yes, but if it's not a filesystem format change, but rather
a "kernel had bugs which have now been fixed" statement, that's not
the sort of thing where I'd think forcing the system administrator to
add a magic command-line flag would be necessary or desirable.  
I could see printing a warning message saying that older kernels might
have problems with this, and I could also imagine including with the
kernel patch enabling some sort of flag that could be queried, perhaps
via /sys/fs/ext3/32bit-nr-blocks so that if it isn't present, mke2fs
could give a more emphatic warning that the current kernel wouldn't be
able to deal with filesystems being created.
