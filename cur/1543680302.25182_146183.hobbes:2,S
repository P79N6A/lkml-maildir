You may be able to identify devices which are very unlikely to be
touched by the SMI handler, and just allow those to be moved.
E.g. video cards, USB, IDE, "system", ISA bridge etc. may all be
touched by the SMI (for power management), but the sound, modem and
network are much less unlikely.
Ok, it's flailing a bit...
