The 'mkinitrd' script is probably different on our systems.  I expect
that distros customize it a bit and I don't have a RH 8.0 version
of it.
The latest version that I found (3.5.14) searches for module files
ending in o.gz, o, or ko.  I expect that you are using a version of
mkinitrd that does not search for module files ending in ko.
You (or I) could modify your mkinitrd file to search for ko module
names, or you could try an updated version of mkinitrd that does
search for modules names that end with ko.
Do you actually want/need the mptbase module in your initrd?
If not, edit /etc/modules.conf and remove that module name.
But mkinitrd needs to be updated to look in /etc/modprobe.conf
instead of /etc/modules.conf for module names.  I expect that
the distros will take care of that.
