	Don't use devfs. One of the known bugs - devfs passes a string to
vfs_follow_link() and doesn't care to preserve it until vfs_follow_link()
is done.
E.g. rmmod during the symlink traversal will end up with
vfs_follow_link(nd, s)
[working]
[blocked on IO/allocation/whatever]
rmmod
...
kfree(s)
...
[the first process wakes up and oopses on attempt to dereference s]
	There are other scenarios that end up freeing a string passed to
vfs_follow_link() (or, for that matter, being busily copied to userland by
readlink(2)).  Basically, if devfs decides that symlink is gone - pray.
If it's being accessed right now you are going to end up with oops.
	No idea why you've started triggering it only now - not enough
details to say.
	And yes, Richard had been informed about that months ago. Sigh...
