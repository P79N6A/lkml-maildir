How do you /know/ it won't just be recycled in the production case?

That is your ultimate goal, not what you are doing, step by step.

Can't ever guarantee that (unless you have the exact memory requirements
beforehand, and enough RAM for the worst case).

What "important stuff"? How come OOM kills it, when there is plenty of

just afraid it could happen by what you see in the "current isolated
non-production, not actually bearing a load test" case?
