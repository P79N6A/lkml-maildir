At least you get a simple solution for your problem: Configure your
system in a slightly different way (once!) and that's it.
There are far too many commercial vendors out there where you probably
wouldn't get an answer at all. And if, days or weeks later.
And if a - in your opinion! - wrong default value (for whatever reason)
is a bug in your universe, then you should probably adopt the
interpretation of words of this universe.
BTW changing the default value in the source now doesn't fix the
sub-optimal default value on your system.

If you don't have the time to fix your problems, why should anyone else
have the time to fix your problems?
That is BTW the typical "i'm your customer and you have to obey me"
attitude. Perhaps you want to buy somewhere the time to fix your
problems.
