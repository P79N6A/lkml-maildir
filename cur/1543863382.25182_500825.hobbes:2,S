I've worked on 2.6.19, but when update to 2.6.20-rc5, the function is changed.

Current Linux page allocation fairly provides pages for every process, since
swap daemon only is started when memory is low, so when it starts to scan
active_list, the private pages of processes are messed up with each other,
vmscan.c:shrink_list() is the only approach to attach disk swap page to page on
active_list, as the result, all private pages lost their affinity on swap
partition. I will give a testlater...
