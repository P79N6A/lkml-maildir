Your error message wasn't the same.
You reported status 0x51 with error code 0x04.  That is the generic
catch-all error message, which usually refers to aborted commands.
Unfortunately, it's tough to know what command the system was
attempting to issue when your drive aborted the command.  There may be
some IDE debugging code you can enable to attempt to find out, but I
don't know exactly how to do that, a linux IDE person will need to
speak up... i'm just a generic IDE person.
The previous poster reported 0x51 with error code 0x80, that is
specifically UDMA CRC errors, and I diagnosed it as such.
