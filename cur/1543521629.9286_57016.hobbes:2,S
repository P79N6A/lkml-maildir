Hi, gang
My configuration has 
...
  CONFIG_PNP=y
  #CONFIG_ISAPNP is not set 
...
I encountered a compile problem with isapnp.c or and <blush> didn't
bother to check the code why.  Instead I modded ~/Makefile to evaluate
CONFIG_ISAPNP instead of CONFIG_PNP (as per ~/drivers/pnp/Makefile).  
It seems that one of them is superfluous (if ~/drivers/pnp is not
destined to contain other stuff at a later stage) or that the wrong
CONFIG_ is used to test.
What bothered me somewhat is that despite CONFIG_ISAPNP not being set,
the final kernel link failed 'cause it couldn't ld isa-pnp.o
(understandably with the current 'ifeq').  Without it the kernel lives
quite happily without it.  Looks like kernel bloat.
