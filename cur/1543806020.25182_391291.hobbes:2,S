Subject: [PATCH] i386: instead of poisoning .init zone, change protection bits to force a fault
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Chasing some invalid accesses to .init zone, I found that free_init_pages() 
was properly freeing the pages but virtual was still usable.
A poisoning (memset(page, 0xcc, PAGE_SIZE)) was done but this is not reliable.
Applying this patch at least in mm is a good thing...
(After that we could map non possible cpu percpu data to the initial 
percpudata that is included in .init and discarded in free_initmem())
