I'd like if it will be written explicitly in the specs that it's forbidden to
rely on that. I grepped the specs and I didn't find anything. So I wasn't sure
if I missed the information in the specs or not. I never investigated on it
because I always considered it bad coding regardless the fact it's guaranteed
to generate the right asm with the _current_ tools.
