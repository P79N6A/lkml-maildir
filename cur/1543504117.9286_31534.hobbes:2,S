aha!
If I do the following which steers the interrupts for all pins
to the bogus irq 9 then I don't get all the interrupts.
# setpci -v -s5.0 60.b=9
# setpci -v -s5.0 61.b=9
# setpci -v -s5.0 62.b=9
Leaving:
# setpci -v -s5.0 63.b
00:05.0:63 = 0b
i.e. pin D (USB controller) steered to IRQ 11 then it works (well
not quite the mouse yet, but I get all the correct debug output).
When I switch them back one pin at a time after loading usbcore
and usb-uhci:
# setpci -v -s5.0 60.b=b
# setpci -v -s5.0 61.b=b
# setpci -v -s5.0 62.b=b
BOOM
So it seems I have continuous interrupts being generated
on pin C. Trouble is I don't anything on pin C according to
lspci.
Is this likely to be a hardware bug?
