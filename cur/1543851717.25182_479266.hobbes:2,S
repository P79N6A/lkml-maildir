True .. It's not mandatory. The reason that I mentioned it is because it
looked like a function was being called outside a function block, which
looks odd to me. I think I overlook the initcall functions because I see
them so often I know what they are.

You get an "A" for research. I didn't notice you actually declare a
variable inside the macro. I thought it was only setting a section
attribute. You right, I don't see how you could call the functions in
the section without the variable declared. ( besides that's exactly how
the initcalls work. )
