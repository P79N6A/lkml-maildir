Look at linux-2.3.41/kernel/fork.c:get_pid():
    if((++last_pid) & 0xffff8000) {
            last_pid = 300;         /* Skip daemons etc. */
            goto inside;
    }
The only reason that comes into my mind is that you want to have
your daemons (more exactly: procs started at system startup) to show
up in the first lines of a ps output sorted by PID...
