Hello,
Ever since I upgraded to the 2.4.x (currently running 2.4.8)
kernels, my machine has been locking up every other day
or so.  Does anyone have any hints/tips for figuring out
what is going on.
The symptons are total lock-up of the machine.  No mouse
movement, all GUI monoitors freeze, and I cannot switch to a
virtual console.  I'm not able to ping the locked machine or
ssh/telnet into it either.  So I'm left wondering....how and
the hell to I debug this problem.  It'd be nice to have some
more information to go on or post to the list.
I'm running on a dual PIII 850, and this problem occurs with
2.4.7 and 2.4.8.
Any suggestions?
Travis
