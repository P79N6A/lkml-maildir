That's interesting. I wasn't awaye you could have a request
containing such a "mixed" set of bh without valid pages.
Actually, I though b_page was always valid. Looking at
other drivers (typically the the csiss.c driver), it also
unconditionally use b_page & bh_phys(). So either we are
looking at a false problem, or that driver need fixing as
well.
Now assuming that mix can happen, I don't like the fact that
your new version will use lastdataend to compare against both
physical and virtual addresses.
While I agree they should usually not collide (as those virtual
addresses are supposed to be grok-able by pci_map_* they are
in the linear mapping while the physical ones will typically
be smaller than c0000000), there is still some risk of
collision especially with HIGHMEM, or did I miss something ?
Maybe the solution is to have an additional variable indicating
if the last bh was virtual or physical, and reset lastdataend
to ~0 when the current one is different...
