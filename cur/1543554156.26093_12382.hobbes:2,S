Most patches applied, thanks.  Comments:
3c505.c:  You must abort if dma_mem_alloc return value is null, not just
print a message.
82596.c:  Not applied.  My moving the "if checksum & 0x100" line, you
make the code comments incorrect.
eth16i.c:  Your diff was not created in the main linux directory...
seeq8005.c:  Applied, but you forgot dev->name in request_region
