I first started useing linux in the 0.88 days, and have been useing it heavily 
for the last 10 years (with custom kernels throughout, first due to the need, 
later for other reasons). During all of that time I have avoided useing 
initramfs or initrd on the several hundred machines I have managed over that 
time.
I personally don't like the idea of booting stuff out of the kernel into a 
userspace 'thing' that needs to be built and maintained in addition to the 
kernel (for that matter I have almost entirely avoided the use of modules as 
well).
however, if kinit/klibc are included with the kernel and a make && make install 
(or similar) will end up createing a blob that will boot, I won't care if the 
blob is entirely kernel or is kernel+initrd with some functionality in 
userspace.
Ted makes a good point that distros will want to further tweak the boot process 
and that the right way is to give them hooks to add their custom stuff. we don't 
want every distro to throw out the thing that the kernel compiles to put in 
their own.
