You're years late to this game. It's been thought about and the
consensus (which I disagreed with) was to reject virtualspace pressure
related changes of this kind for 32-bit platforms in favor of refusing
to support 32-bit platforms and/or workloads requiring them.
Also, please line wrap at 80 characters (preferably 70) and please
don't top post. The request about "top posting" is that placing quoted
text prior to your responses in the message, with a line attributing the
quoted text to the original author immediately above the quoted text is
greatly preferred over the quoting arrangements made in your post(s).
