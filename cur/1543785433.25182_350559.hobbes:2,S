I am not clear either, but I would think that kmap_atomic() would return
a pointer to the beginning of the page.  There is also an assumption that
there is only one page.  If page_base needs to be used to offset from
the address returned by kmap_atomic(), then I wouldn't think that the
current test is correct.  I think that it needs to take page_base into
account when checking for the boundary.
    Thanx...
