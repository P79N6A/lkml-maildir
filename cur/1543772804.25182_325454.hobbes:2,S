Hi.
A related issue I had is that some codepages don't have a nls module
yet. 
For example I once or twice needed to mount a vfat filesystem with
cp1256 ( arabic windows ) charset. There is no such nls module. I
couldn't find any documentation about how to create the module ( maybe I
didn't look hard enough ).
Therefore a filesystem used by old windows versions having arabic names
is unusable.
