Okay.

Yes. ->cpus_allowed is protected by rq->lock. Do not look at the midget
behind the curtain for what protects ->cpus_allowed of a sleeping task.

You looked at the midget behind the curtain. Anyway, rq->lock is just
reused based on the sleeping task's cpu affinity.
->array == NULL while a task is running should not happen apart from
a dequeueing in progress. ->array should be protected by
per_cpu(runqueues, task_cpu(task)).lock.
Scheduler-private fields of tasks are considered to be under the
protection of per_cpu(runqueues, task_cpu(task)).lock until someone
succeeds in a double runqueue lock acquisition and moves the task
between two cpus, or as an optimization, to reset task->thread_info->cpu
under its current rq->lock without holding the target's lock if it's not
queued anywhere.
There is some retry logic in task_rq_lock() to make sure the cpu and
the runqueue are consistent that resolves the remainder of the cases.
