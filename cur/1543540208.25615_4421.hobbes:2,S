I haven't tried too hard, but I'm sure that I could do a benchmark that
shows the speed difference by the cache usage of the single pointer list
and the double pointer list for a big table.
Anyways, the current lists are very slow on x86 because you always need
an additional register to cache the head when you walk the list (it shows 
clearly when you look at disassembly listings) 
So when you look at it with your speed freak hat on, would you reconsider it ?
