It take days, each experiment is 5 hours.  Previous experiments on 2.6.8
shows that the sweet spot was 12.5ms.
This time on 2.6.11, it got pushed into 16 ms.  Results comparing to 10ms:
 8 ms  -0.3%
10 ms  --
12 ms	+0.11%
16 ms +0.14%
20 ms +0.06%
12ms and up all has about 1.5% idle time.  We are not anywhere near the
limits on what the disk storage can deliver.  So there is a potential to
to tune/optimize the scheduler and reap these extra idle time.
