Casey's earlier message suggested this too.  'Integrity' here in
particular does not mean online integrity guarantees through, i.e.,
information flow control.  So perhaps instead of 'integrity' we should
make sure to always say 'integrity measurement'.  Of course then there
is already the 'integrity measurement architecture' which is only one
implementation of a LIM module, right?   So it would need to be renamed
to TIMA (TPM-enabled IMA) or something I guess.
