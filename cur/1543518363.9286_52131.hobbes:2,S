There's a ton of details like this that are worth exploring,
but that right now are not worth it because we don't have the
infrastructure.
gettimeofday() is a great example. We don't just want to assume "rdtsc" in
user space, and even if we did we wouldn't want to re-calibrate all the
time. But yes, it would work very nicely indeed with the global area
approach (and when the CPU doesn't have rdtsc, the global area would just
do an old-fashioned system call).
A "node ID" may be another global static thing that would be useful in the
future, but that's certainly not an issue today.

Oh, you can't do that. SYSENTER just loses all the information, so you
don't really have much choice: you can't get it right as far as I can
tell.
I was more thinking about the case where SYSENTER was used for the vm86()
system call, and you'd have to be careful _not_ to use SYSEXIT because you
can't use SYSEXIT to return to vm86 mode - you have to use the same old
"iret" for that case. That shouldn't be too hard: just check the flags on
the return path and if the flags imply a return to VM86 you just use the
old path.
The same is true of Wine: you just need to check the DS/SS segment values
on return (and if they are anything but USER_DS you need to use "iret"
again).
You may have all this code already, I was just wondering. It doesn't look
like rocket science, but it _does_ look like there's just a lot of details
that need to be just right...

The thing is, you don't even have enough information to know whether the
user was co-operative or not. A "bad" use of SYSENTER will look exactly
like a good one, so you really cannot tell. As such, I wouldn't worry
about the issue, because there is nothing you can possibly do about it
anyway.
Silly SYSENTER semantics.

How would you know to _exit()? You'll just have to think that it's a real
system call, and then on the return path the process will probably receive
a SIGSEGV because the stack is crap etc.. But that's ok - just another bad
pointer dereference..

Does it matter?
