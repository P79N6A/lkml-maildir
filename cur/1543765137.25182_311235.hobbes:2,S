I had assumed Ladislav wanted to be able to change this charge rate at
any time, which was the motivation behind adding ds1339 support.

It is used by the Radstone ppc7d platform, arch/ppc/radstone_ppc7d.c
but wasn't added until very recently (2.6.12-rc2 I think).
To be honest, I meant to remove the 'id' thing before submitting the
driver. There's no need to support more than one of these devices.

Yep. I think the id should be removed asap.

Initializing the charge register should be done by the bios if possible.
However, I assume Ladislav still wants to be able to change the register
at runtime so some kernel support is needed?

This makes sense. Ladislav, would this work for you? I guess we'd still
add code to the ds1337 driver to detect ds1339 in order to ensure that
this tool could not modify register 0 of a ds1337 by accident?
