Hi Dave,
I applied the patch to test the chelsio drivers.
The compilation of the forcedeth driver fails if CONFIG_FORCEDETH_NAPI 
is not set.
/opt/sources/linux-2.6/drivers/net/forcedeth.c: In function `nv_nic_irq':
/opt/sources/linux-2.6/drivers/net/forcedeth.c:2866: error: structure 
has no member named `weight'
/opt/sources/linux-2.6/drivers/net/forcedeth.c: In function 
`nv_nic_irq_optimized':
/opt/sources/linux-2.6/drivers/net/forcedeth.c:2983: error: structure 
has no member named `weight'
/opt/sources/linux-2.6/drivers/net/forcedeth.c: In function `nv_nic_irq_rx':
/opt/sources/linux-2.6/drivers/net/forcedeth.c:3177: error: structure 
has no member named `weight'
The compilation of the cxgb driver also fails if CONFIG_CHELSIO_T1_NAPI 
is not set, but it has nothing to do with your patch.
I'm looking into it.
Cheers,
Divy
