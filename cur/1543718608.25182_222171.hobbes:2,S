Subject: What's the most compatible gcc/glibc?

I'm using gcc2.95.3 and glib2.2.5-34 and these compiles and runs nearly 
all sources.
But, now I need to compile ipw2100 for Centrino notebook, and that 
requires gcc3.x
Will someone be able to advise on what's the best gcc/glibc to use for 
gcc3.x that would compile/run mozilla, linux.2.6, uml and still runs 
sybase12.x and vmware4.x
Thanks,
Jeff
