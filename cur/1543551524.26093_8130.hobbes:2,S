Subject: unresolved symbols in ipx module

About a year ago there was a short thread about unresolved symbols in the
ipx module, which doesn't appear to have come to a solution.  I have just
had the same problem, and have some new information to add.
(kernel 2.2.16 on Redhat 6.2)
The problem:  "depmod -ae" says
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.2.16/misc/ipx.o
depmod:         make_EII_client
depmod:         destroy_EII_client
depmod:         register_8022_client_Rsmp_934262ba
depmod:         unregister_8022_client_Rsmp_7acef15d
depmod:         register_snap_client_Rsmp_612bcc66
depmod:         unregister_snap_client_Rsmp_9abefc50
depmod:         make_8023_client
depmod:         destroy_8023_client
The cause:
I was running a kernel without ipx capabilities, but decided I wanted to
mount some Netware volumes.  So I assumed I could just compile the
appropriate modules, add them to the running kernel, and away I go...
Unfortunately the above error happens.
Looking around the kernel sources, I see that the symbols are defined in 
net/ethernet/pe2.c, net/802/p8022.c, net/802/p8023.c, and net/802/psnap.c.
If I understand the Makefiles correctly, the EII, 8022, and snap symbols
are compiled directly into the kernel, but only if IPX_CONFIG is defined.
This means to add ipx to the kernel, I have to rebuild the entire kernel
and boot with it in order to satisfy the dependancies.  I cannot just
compile it as a module and add it because it has non-modular dependancies.
OTOH, make_8023_client and destroy_8023_client are already in the kernel,
but are still not resolving.  I haven't figured that out yet.  Any hints?
I hope this defines the problem well enough that someone more experienced
than me can fix it.  Or give me some pointers on what to do.  I assume it
would require making pe2, p8022, p8023, and psnap modular, but I don't
know how to do that yet.
