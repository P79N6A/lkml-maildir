Sounds suspiciously like a non-exec stack to me - there has been plenty of
discussion of how/why that achieves nothing (you just need to change the
exploit code slightly).

It doesn't stop anything - just changes the nature of the exploit needed
(i.e. the skr1pt k1dd13s need to find v2 of their little skr1pt). The
opinion round here seems to be that this isn't worth the hassle?
