IIRC, that's the key. 
There was never a real issue about notify_on_release on the internal 
locking of the cpusets. But with the VFS...
The problem lies in how the VFS takes the semaphores on the inodes
when doing a rmdir(). It locks the parent's inode, and then the child's 
inode. And because of the cascading cpuset removal with the previous 
'autoclean' feature, the cpuset code tried to do the same thing, but in 
the reverse order. There was once a version of the code that seemed to 
work, but with inodes semaphores released and re-taken in the good order. 
Ugly, and unsafe.
(All this from memory, I don't guarantee its accuracy).
