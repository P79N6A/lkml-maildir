Well the demo code shows that they are duplicate entries as far as the
ioctl() call is concerned and you have to delete twice to get rid
of them. `route` `ip` etc., all make the same ioctl() calls that
the demo code does. There is no other way into the kernel.
I looked at the code ../linux/net/ipv4/fib_frontend.c line 266 and
thought I could make a quick hack to repeatably delete routes.
However, since the first route found is not actually deleted,
there is only a `promise` to delete it, a loop in that section of
code will not work.
If I get some time, I will look deeper. There must be (is) some
way to delete all routining table entries that correspond to a
specific route.
