Do you have problems with printer detection? I discovered that mine Epson
Stylus Color 740 raise the nDataAvail line even if there' s still data. So
now I am using the timeout to know that there's no avaible data anymore. 
Now works ;). Tomorrow I should have time to reverse engeneering the whole
1284 nibble reverse channel of my printer, maybe I'll discover something
to avoid having to base the code on the timeout to see the name of my
printer on the syslog. 
BTW, Very usful isnt't it ? ;) Maybe I'll forget the name of my printer ;))
