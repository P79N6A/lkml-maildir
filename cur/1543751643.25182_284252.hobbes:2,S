They didn't fix their code because it worked - no reason to do so.
Telling people "this is going away in 12 months" gives them reason to fix
the code.  And a reasonable amount of time to do so and to distribute the
new version.

Maybe, maybe not.  But is it appropriate for us to be trying to control
someone else's internal activities via alterations to the kernel?

I doubt if people would be silly enough to use a deprecated export in new
code after the export has been scheduled for removal.  If they do then yes,
sorry, we have to draw the line somewhere.
You still have not demonstrated any benefit to any party from not delaying
the removal of these two exports.
