This is not in line with my expirences, I have quite a few 2.2 boxes under
extreme load.

Doctor doctor it hurts when I move my arm like this.. Then dont move your
arm like that!
My four main PII computers at home mount almost everything off a PPRO
Knfsd server running 2.2.3 which has a good uptime uptime and I've had no
problems. (this is on switched 100mbit ethernet, the server has 256megs of
ecc ram and does software raid on 9 disks, so dont tell me that my 'home'
load is not a test case.)

Wouldn't know about that.

Come on! Lets have some details, Please! I have three SMP boxes (dual
PPRO, dual P5, and dual PII450) all under heavy load of all sorts and have
NEVER had a panic on any Linux kernel version>2.0.33 (cept the p5 when I
was playing with schedular code)

Wouldn't know, no SMP alpha boxes here.. :(

Errors? Can't say I've seen that.. As for warnings, the stupid compiler
doesn't always know best.

Can you please post your decoded oppses?

Thats good, but it would be much more useful if you would kindly produce
some useful bug reports (please excuse me if you already have and I missed
your posts).
