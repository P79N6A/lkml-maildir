  It was mangled in the exact same way.  Fortunately, I was able to decipher
the "quoted-printable" format and apply the patch.
  Unfortunately, I get the following errors during "make modules" in the
context of a 2.2.13 kernel.

It appears the ntohl function is actually a macro that parenthesizes its
argument (whee) which means that when you pass in an unsigned int, you get
back an unsigned int so you should probably cast each return value of ntohl to
an unsigned long to suppress this error message.
  I guess the long-term fix would be to change the definition of the macro
ntohl in /usr/include/netinet/in.h (as opposed to the function declaration for
ntohl; argh) to be 
# define ntohl(x)       ((unsigned long)(x))
  Since unsigned long and unsigned int on the i386 are the same size, this is
only a cosmetic error for me, but should still be addressed.
  We'll see if the patched driver can make my OnStream act less wacky.  After
successfully filling around 10 tapes, I've had two tapes in a row (from the
same box) which write out fine, but get errors reading logical block 0.  PITA
