Very nice spin indeed.
This reminds of the the utterly broken dl2k network driver (which has
got interrupt handling problems and doesn't properly synchronize with
DMA transfers, IIRC).  Hardware specs are available, and I guess I
could even provide a hardware sample, maybe even two.  (If the
community provides driver support, it shouldn't matter if the vendor
actually supports development.)
