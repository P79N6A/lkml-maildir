I'm in agreement on that, ...

I think it might be an idea myself, but not at this stage, I think a month
or two from now it might be a better time, if we get an agreeable
re-design done, then I'd be willing to let a fork proceed from that point,
so that at least the DRMs are all coming from the same point,
I think we should hold off on putting 2d stuff into the 3d drivers until
the DRM is rearchitected into a nice clean stable system that is actually
liked by kernel developers :-), I'm pushing the second set of macros
removals to Linus over the next week, along with experimenting on a
core/library tree...
Dave.
