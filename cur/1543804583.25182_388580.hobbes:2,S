At this point I have to confess I have been working on something
similar, to IBM's pid virtualization work.  But I have what is at
least for me a unifying concept, that makes things easier to think
about.
The idea is to think about things in terms of namespaces.  Currently
in the kernel we have the fs/mount namespace already implemented.
Partly this helps on what the interface for creating a new namespace
instance should be.  'clone(CLONE_NEW<NAMESPACE_TYPE>)', and how
it should be managed from the kernel data structures.
Partly thinking of things as namespaces helps me scope the problem.
Does this sound like a sane approach?
