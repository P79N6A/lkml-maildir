It's standard practice to create patches so that they apply with -p1. 
See Documentation/SubmittingPatches
Don't just indiscriminately run lindent.  It makes the code look awful
in some spots.  Remember that it's OK to exceed 80 columns in some
places, especially with things like function declarations.
in hvcs_write():
	count = min(count, (int)PAGE_SIZE);
assumes that count and PAGE_SIZE are in the same units: bytes.  If
that's true, no need for the sizeof() here:
charbuf = kmalloc(sizeof(unsigned char *) * count,  GFP_KERNEL);
hvcs_next_partner() shares code with lparcfg_write() and a bunch of the
other hypervisor calls.  Can you combine them with a function that just
checks the return codes from hcalls?  All of those switches look
redundant.   
hvcs_get_partner_info() is a bit long.  Can that while loop go into its
own function?
