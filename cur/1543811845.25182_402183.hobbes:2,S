You can get a fair approximation of that information by monitoring
/proc/diskstats or the relevant counter files under /sys. Simply turn
on the logical LED if the IO counter has been incremented in the last
(say) 30ms. The only time this is likely to be noticable different
than the physical LED is when the drive is in some initialization
state or error condition.
For an amusing ready-made graphical version, try the gkhdplop plugin of gkrellm.
