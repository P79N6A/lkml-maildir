ok, thanks. 
so we really only have 3k stacks rather than 4k stacks, right? if any
code exceeds 3k stacks and is preempted by an interrupt, we can
trigger this check and hang the system as a result (I notice that at
least RHEL 4's kernels enable this check by default, not sure about
other kernels).
Thanks,
Terence
