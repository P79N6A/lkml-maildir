Ok thanks for the information. I will stare a bit at the patch.
It is very mysterious though. Even if the patch was somehow wrong
the worst thing that could happen is that you end up with interrupts
off when you shouldnt, and the NMI watchdog is very good 
at catching that.
Hmm actually - on some systems I broke the NMI watchdog. Can you
check your dmesg to see if check_nmi_watchdog doesnt report it 
as stuck? If yes please put a return on top of check_nmi_watchdog
that should fix it. You can verify it works by looking at the
per CPU NMI counters in /proc/interrupts. An nmi watchdog
backtrace would be nice to see.
