Depend on the amount of memory.
If asynchronous read-ahead is working for 1000 sequential IO streams on
1000 different files with MAX_READAHEAD=31, your system needs about:
(32+32) * 1 PAGE * 1000 = 256 MB
just for read-ahead data.

I donnot recommend you to try this value, even if the read-ahead code may
be smart enough to detect trashing and use an average value more
reasonnable.

The asynchronous read-ahead code tries to eliminate IO latency by starting
the next IO in advance. This is probably not useful for the situation you
describe. Optimizing the head movements in indeed the smartest thing to
try given the IO pattern you describe.
In my opinion, your system is probably trashing a lot:
Buffers : (256K + 64K + 96K) * 1000 = 416 MB. Code and various datas
(notably kernel socket datas): probably far more than 100 MB.
Total greater than 512 MB.
May-be you should either:
- Use a smaller number of clients.
or
- Increase memory size up to 1 GB, for example.
or
- Use smaller buffers, for example:
    MAX_READAHEAD=15
    32K file buffer
    32K socket buffer
