Ok I tryed to write some basic modules and all of a sudden I can't link them
with the latest test7, went trough the EXPORT declaration and saw the reason
those symbols aren't exported at all, went back to 2.2.16 and the EXPORT
statements are in place, why is this are there some new functions which 
should replace this as a interface to proc from module's side, or is just a 
omission which hasn't been noticed yet, altrough i see that in test6 and so on.
Regards, Velizar
