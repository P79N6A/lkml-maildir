    summary:     [SPARC64]: Move signal compat bits to new header file.
which added the line:
    extern void sigset_from_compat(sigset_t *set, compat_sigset_t *compat);
my crosstool compile of sparc64 for 2.6.18-mm3 stopped building.
    $ make init/main.o
fails on the "sigset_t *set", with:
    In file included from include/asm/signal.h:11,
		     from include/linux/signal.h:4,
		     from include/linux/sched.h:67,
		     from include/linux/module.h:9,
		     from init/main.c:13:
    include/linux/compat.h:231: error: parse error before '*' token
    include/linux/compat.h:231: warning: function declaration isn't a prototype
    make[1]: *** [init/main.o] Error 1

P.S. -- Looks like I'm not the first to notice.  Adding Dr. von Brand
        and Andrew to my cc list.
