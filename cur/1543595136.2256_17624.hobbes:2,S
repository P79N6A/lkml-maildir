SGI's source control system marks the supplied files as read only to
prevent accidental updates.  That causes problems when generated files
are updated in place, see my long memo about why this is bad.  I am
guessing that SGI had problems with the earlier version of your
Makefile (it always generated the files) so they excluded the generated
files from their repository.
Changing aic7xxx kbuild so it does not overwrite supplied files will
fix this class of problem for all source repositories, not just SGI.
