Stephen,
Did a lot of stress testing this evening on the changes we discussed
today.  I have discovered that unless lock_kernel() is also held over
calls to wait_on_buffer() after calling ll_rw_block(), I start getting
DMA timeouts on the IDE controller (indicating it's getting memory
that's not 512-byte aligned).  If lock_kernel() is held over this call,
no problem. 
A few more hours of heavy stress testing to go .....
