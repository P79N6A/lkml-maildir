Ahh, well..
The kernel source code is set up to scale quite well, so yes a "make -j"
will parallellise a bit teoo well for most machines, and you'll certainly
run out of memory on just about anything (I routinely get load averages of
30+, and yes, you need at least half a GB of RAM for it to not be
unpleasant - and probably more like a full gigabyte on an alpha).
So I definitely think the kernel likely did the right thing. It's not even
clear that the OOM killer might not have been right - due to the 2.4.x
swap space allocation, 256MB of swap-space is a bit tight on a 384MB
machine that actually wants to use a lot of memory.

Note that it might easily have been 256MB into swap (ie it had eaten _all_
of your swap) at some stage - and you just didn't see it in the vmstat
output because obviously at that point the machine was a bit loaded.
But neutering the OOM killer like Alan suggested may be a rather valid
approach anyway. Delaying the killing sounds valid: if we're truly
livelocked on the VM, we'll be calling down to the OOM killer so much that
it's probably quite valid to say "only return 1 after X iterations".
