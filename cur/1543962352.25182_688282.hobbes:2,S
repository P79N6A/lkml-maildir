OK. I'll introduce the clk_set_rate_propagate that should be used as a
->set_rate callback. The get_rate logic (to default to the parent
clock) seems to be OK from my POV. Will that suite you?

Yes and no. Nearly all platforms have some type of clk_register. But
to use it you have to burry deeply in the platform code. There is no
easy way for a driver to provide clocks on both the PXA and SA-1100
arms, not telling about other platforms.

Nearly all platform-dependant code is still left in hands of platform
maintainers. There are only few assumptions built into the clocklib.
And I've just agreed to remove one of them.

Tell me more please about "flexible usecounting". Or please provide
pointers to relevant threads I can read.

I don't think that's the way to go. It's pretty stupid to force all
maintainers to agree to worse code only to make it better.
I still didn't receive any strong objections regarding the PXA and
SA-1100. Few other ARM architectures that have simple clk.h would gain
from clocklib by being able to drop non-platform-specific code. The
AVR32 maintainer seems to be looking positievly to adapting clocklib
once it's merged.
Maybe we should merge the core part only for now, to let all platform
maintainers consider it, think about it, provide patches to clocklib
that will be carefully though out and later (when dust settles) merge
the remaining bits of platform support?
