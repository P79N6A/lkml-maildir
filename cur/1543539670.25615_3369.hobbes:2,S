What IS the solution?
If the drivers can be done in the userspace then the damage can be done in
the userspace (assuming the hardware can be damaged).
I assume that root-level userspace comprimise is possible (statistics show that
it happens too often to ignore it - like it or not). So the kernel should
protect all hardware form being damaged.
We can restrict these ioctls and direct access to i/o ports with capabilities.
OTOH:
* We want to use some mapped memory & ports (xfree)
  Solution exists as a memory and port range enabler
  So the side channel (doing direct io) can be closed for unnecessary
  access.
* We want to use raw ide & scsi & etc commands. This is a problem.
  Is a general safe filter even possible (such that cd writing, zip dives
  etc continue to work)? I assume this is not possible.
So the only 'bulletproof' way is to do all hardare access in kernel and not
provide userspace _any_ methods for doing it directly. This means all zip
drivers & graphics drivers & so on in the kernel :-(
Therefore:
_IF_ the hardware can be damaged THEN no userspace application must be able to
access it directly and to use such devices, a kernel level driver must exist to
provide all the access safely.
Or am I missing something?
