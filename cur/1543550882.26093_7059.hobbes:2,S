    I hope this is going to the right list/group/etc, as I got this email
address from someone on #kernelnewbies...
    Attempting to mkraid /dev/md0 a raid5 array using a Buslogic Flashpoint
fast SCSI PCI card will always hard lock the system at exactly 2% complete.
There is no oops or log, and it's a total lockup.  I can't even switch
virtual terminals when it locks.  Using an AHA-2940UW in place of the
buslogic works perfectly.
    This is using kernel 2.2.17 with the raid 0.90 B0 patch which applied
cleanly.  I was wondering if it was raid, but since the 2940 worked, I
started to wonder about the Buslogic card driver maybe.

    A cut-and-paste of the rebuild in progress.  It completed normally and
was usable after that on the 2940.  I will test any other variations of
tests I can think of and give the results.
    Any information on even how I can troubleshoot this further would be
appreciated!
