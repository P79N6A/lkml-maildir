Such level of detail really belongs to debugging, IMHO.
I think, it would suffer to say, how many channels are in use.
So you can answer the question, whether your customers are actually
using this experimental technology. 
If you want more, let them mount debugfs. 
If it becomes really important, we can revisit this later.
Thats the advantage of files under debugfs 
not being stable API in any way.
BTW: What is the actual frequency, at which such counters 
will be incremented?
