Yeah.  There are a lot of "screw"s in this thread.
I wonder if RCU can save us - if we do an rcu_read_lock() we at least know
that the dentries won't get deallocated.  Then we can take a look at
d_parent (which might not be the parent any more).  Once in a million years
we might send a false event or miss sending an event, depending on where
our dentry suddenly got moved to.  Not very nice, but at least it won't
oops.
