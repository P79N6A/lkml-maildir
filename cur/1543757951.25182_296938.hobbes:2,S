I had to apply this manually, since your mailer "corrupts" the patch by 
encoding text/plain as base64.  Please fix your mailer...
The ideal is an inline patch, rather than an attachment anyway.  e.g.
To: ...
From: ...
Subject: ...
<blank line>
Patch description
Patch
cat'd to 'sendmail -t'.  Sendmail (or another MTA which provides a 
/usr/sbin/sendmail wrapper) will automatically fill in other headers 
like Message-ID and Date.
