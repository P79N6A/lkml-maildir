You know, SCO sounds like the guys I've worked with when they failed a 
drug test - "C'mon, I was at a party, I was only around the stuff, I 
never touched it, you can't fire me!"
 From 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_v._IBM
 :
SCO currently claims:
     * Any code belonging to SCO that might have been GPL'd was done by 
SCO employees without proper legal authorization, and thus is not 
legally GPL'd.
     * That for code to be GPL'd, the code's copyright owner must put a 
GPL notice before the code, but since SCO itself wasn't the one to add 
the notices, the code was never GPL'd.
and:
SCO's major claims have now been reported as relating to the following 
components of the Linux kernel:
     * symmetric multiprocessing (SMP),
     * non-uniform memory access (NUMA) multiprocessing,
     * the read-copy-update (RCU) locking strategy,
     * SGI's Extended File System (XFS),
     * and IBM's JFS journaling file system
These claims flow from the accusation of breach of contract. The 
contract between IBM and AT&T (to which SCO claims to be successor in 
interest) allows IBM to use the SVR4 code, but the SVR4 code, plus any 
derivative works made from that code, must be held confidential by IBM. 
According to IBM's interpretation of the contract, and the 
interpretation published by AT&T in their "$ echo" newsletter in 1985, 
"derivative works" means any works containing SVR4 code. But according 
to SCO's interpretation, "derivative works" also includes any code built 
on top of SVR4, even if that does not contain, or even never contained, 
any SVR4 code. Thus, according to SCO, any AIX operating system code 
that IBM developed must be kept confidential, even if it contains 
nothing from SVR4.
so:
If SCO is saying that any code in the kernel that belongs to SCO was 
done by SCO employees, then why are they suing IBM?
Are they claiming that AIX was developed by SCO employees?
Or are they claiming that Linux was developed former SCO employees 
working for IBM?
