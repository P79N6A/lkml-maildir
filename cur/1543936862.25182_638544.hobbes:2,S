current wake up order is simply FIFO by poll(2) called.
because the VM cannot know how much amount each process can do in free.
the process rss and freeable memory is not proportional.
thus I adopt wake up one after another until restoration memory shortage.

poll() with never timeout don't fill your requirement?
to be honest, maybe I don't understand your afraid yet. sorry.
