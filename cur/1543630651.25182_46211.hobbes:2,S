Subject: Q: x86 interrupt arrival after cli

Quick question for the x86 gurus:
If a hardware interrupt arrives within a spin_lock_irqsave &
spin_unlock_irqrestore will the interrupt handler associated with said
interrupt be called immediately after the spinlock is released?  
I am interested in any delays, even those less then a jiffie.
Cheers,
Bart.
