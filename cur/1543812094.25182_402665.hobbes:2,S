If I'm not mistaken, writing to the device with cat will output that file  
byte by byte. This would probably be even harder on the device than using  
a formatted device with o_sync, since it would dirty a 64k block 64k times!
It seems some of the less elaborate devices dont support this type of use.
I suspect if you had tried using dd with a suitable bs you may still own a  
crap Yahoo usb device.
Just because the linux kernel lets us use the abstract /dev devices freely  
does not mean everything you can do with a /dev is a good idea for all h/w  
that gets a device name.
I think that is the heart of the problem. Manufacturers are designing  
these devices for the windows market. They are specifically designed and  
supplied, preformatted with a fat fs, to be used in that way.
If linux distros, MacOS or anybody else wants to claim to support these  
devices the default setup should probably handle the devices in a  
_similar_ way to the native windows drivers.
