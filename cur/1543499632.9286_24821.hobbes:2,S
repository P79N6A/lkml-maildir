i've attached a quick patch against 2.2.10 that at least prevents the box
from crashing, but this is a completely incorrect fix. I've been running
the exploit for some 15 minutes now without crashing.
The bug appears to be that a TCP localhost bind bucket disappears
mysteriously from under a living socket - thus tcp_bindify() within
tcp_ipv4_rehash finds no bucket and crashes on a NULL ptr. I've also
hacked unbindify to ignore not bound sockets - an obvious side-effect of
the first hack. Anyway, with this hack my box doesnt crash anymore from
the exploit - better than nothing. Maybe the Cc:-ed TCP gods have a better
idea what is really going on? :)
