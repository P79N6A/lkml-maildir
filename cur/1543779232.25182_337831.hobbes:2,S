This was some kind of (ACPI related?) kernel bug.  I upgraded from Hoary
(2.6.11) to Breezy (2.6.12) and the problem which had been 100%
reproducible went away.
One strange thing I noticed was some strange APM/ACPI related messages
in the logs when starting X (APM: overridden by ACPI or something).  Now
I don't get these and the X log just says /dev/apm_bios: No such device.
Oh well, it's working now.
