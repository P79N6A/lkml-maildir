Care to mention what device(s) you saw this with?   And what HCD?

This logic looks wrong.  If that ever happens, surely the problem is
that the rx_submit() code submitted an urb with transfer_size that
mismatched the SKB.  The host controller isn't allowed to overrun the
end of the buffer it's passed.  And if it's tempted to do so, it's
supposed to fill up to the end (skb->end in this case...) and then
report urb->status of -EOVERFLOW.
If you insist on changing this bit of logic, then the best way to
ignore the packet is just to force urb->status to -EOVERFLOW
