In Documentation/atomic_ops.txt atomic_set/atomic_read are described as
nothing more than a type-safe assignement or reading, without any extra
semantics. For other atomic operations, the rule is that any atomic
operation that doesn't return a value doesn't come with a barrier (and
any operation that returns the atomic value must have memory barriers).
So I guess you are suggesting to change the doc and the implementation
for all arches.
I should admit I did not knew a number of atomic operations did not
imply memory-barriers before. But maybe the extra cost might not be
completely negligible, especially if, for consistency with other
"barrier-implied" atomic operations, a new memory barrier is put before
and after,
Are you suggested changing just atomic_set(), or also other barrier-free
atomic operations :"atomic_dec", "atomic_inc", "atomic_add", "atomic_sub" ?
Independently of what is done to atomic, what about not making the .gate
field an atomic_t, but a simple "int" in the mttr code, since the only
operations done on it are atomic_read and atomic_set?
