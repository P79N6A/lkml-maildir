Release 1.9.2: Thu Nov 29 05:43:40 EST 2001
	* Rulebase and help sync with 2.4.17-pre1/2.5.1-pre3.
	* Rulebase now includes a KERNEL symbol usable in visibilities 
	  so it can track both sides of the 2.4/2.5 fork.
	* Search no longer disables suppression of invisible symbols;
	  they still show up on the results menu, however.
	* Fix for a bug in the compiler's type deduction for derived symbols.
	* Attempted fix for a visibility bug reported by Keith Owens.
No bugs pending (assuming the fix for Keith's visibility bug works).
Keith has pointed out a weakness in the language -- there's no way to make
the default value of a choices menu dependent on the architecture (an issue
for things like kcore format).  I am meditating on this.

As the Founding Fathers knew well, a government that does not trust its honest,
law-abiding, taxpaying citizens with the means of self-defense is not itself
worthy of trust. Laws disarming honest citizens proclaim that the government
is the master, not the servant, of the people.
