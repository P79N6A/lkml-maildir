s/D3cold/D2bios/ if that's easier to think about :)  I think we can 
apply reboot and poweroff scenarios to the device tree without a 
problem, was the basic point.  It's just another device powerdown state. 
 Instead of powering off the PCI bridge, (random example) we restore the 
PCI bridge settings to exactly the state it was in when the BIOS booted 
the kernel.
