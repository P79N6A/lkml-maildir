So which bits do we want to merge? For example, Suspend2
kernel/power/ui.c, kernel/power/compression.c, and
kernel/power/encryption.c seem pointless now that we have uswsusp.
Furthermore, being the shameless Linus cheerleader that I am, I got
the impression that we should fix the snapshot/shutdown logic in the
kernel which Suspend2 doesn't really address?
