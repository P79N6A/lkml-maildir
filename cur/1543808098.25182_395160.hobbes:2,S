I agree entirely and wish I could have put it that well.

Hmm, perhaps what should be done is that someone needs to write and
maintain a patch that linux users can apply to cdrecord (since other OSs
are different and hence have no reason to use such a patch), to make it
behave in a manner which is sane on linux.  It should of course be
clearly marked as having been changed in such a way.  It should use udev
if available and HAL and whatever else is appropriate on a modern linux
system, and if on an old system it should at least not break the
interfaces that already worked on those systems in cdrecord.
cdrecord does a wonderful job writing CDs, once you get the silly
command line syntax right and figure out which device option it wants
you to tell it to access your write.  I still find the syntax of
driveropts=option=value is a bit odd, although the linux kernel does the
same thing for some kernel boot arguments as far as I recall, so who am
I to argue.
growisofs has a lovely simple interface, although it probably only has
about 1% as many options as cdrecord.  Perhaps there are just a lot
fewer weird variations on DVDs so far so less options are needed, or
perhaps there are a lot more options but they are all secret and in the
source code.  I haven't needed to use them at least.
