Subject: [PATCH 04/11] KConfig: Add KConfig entries for SELinux labeled NFS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/27/427

This patch adds two entries into the fs/KConfig file. The first entry
NFS_V4_SECURITY_LABEL enables security label support for the NFSv4 client while
the second entry NFSD_V4_SECURITY_LABEL enables security labeling support on
the server side. These entries are currently marked as EXPERIMENTAL to indicate
that at the moment they are only suitable for testing purposes and that the
functionality they provide may change before it is removed from experimental
status.
