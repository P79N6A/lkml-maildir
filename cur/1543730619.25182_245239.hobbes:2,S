multiple drivers acquiring the same bridge lock? ugh.
Which bridge sees an error may be a parent (or child) of the PCI bridge
we are monitoring. I suspect we will have to live with multiple
devices being impacted by errors on a bus and the error recovery
notify/resyncronize with all impacted devices.
Does anyone expect to recover from devices attempting unmapped DMA?
Ie an IOMMU which services multiple PCI busses getting a bad DMA address
will cause the next MMIO read by any of the (grandchildren) PCI devices to 
see an error (MCA on IA64). I'm asking only to determine if this is
outside the scope of what the PCI error recovery is trying to support.

Yeah...I guess my comments are along the same vein.
