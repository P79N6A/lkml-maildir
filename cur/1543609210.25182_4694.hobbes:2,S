Hi Andrew,

I too thought bad hardware.  I will try removing the extra 64M I added
recently and see if it still happens.
>Could you please force a `fsck' against the fs, let us know the

After a crash I say Y (within 5 seconds) on reboot to run an fsck and there
are usually corrupted files from what I was doing when it crashed.  Eg I was
running rpm -Uvh kernel-sources... and some files in /usr/src/linux... were
corrupted.
>Also, a ksymoops trace of the oops output would be most useful.
How do I do this when the box has crashed?  I can manually write down the
oops, but then what do I do?  Can I manually look up System.map to get what
you need?

I agree.  Everything is pointing to the new memory, even though I
successfully ran memtest86 for 10 hours.
Thanks
