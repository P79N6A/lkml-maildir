Thanks for verification.
Hmm, I don't immediately see how this patch could make neigh->lock owner 
to change between lock and unlock ... I have skimmed through the solicit 
methods, and they don't seem to be doing anything nasty to neigh ...
The scenario I was thinking about is that before 69cc64d8d92, if any of 
the _solicit methods could do anything bad to neigh struct, this warning 
wouldn't trigger, because the lock has been dropped before calling 
_solicit() and reacquired later, so no mismatch on ->current could happen, 
but now as long as the lock is held during _solicit() call, this would 
trigger on the next unlock.
But I am not able to see anything like that in the code. Dave, do you have 
any idea? (the thread started at
