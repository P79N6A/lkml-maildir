Yes, some OEMs (IBM, for one. I'm sure there are more) enter SMM when
executing control methods. The interpreter is just blithely going along
and writing values to mem and io ports -- it doesn't know it just
invoked SMM. Nothing is disabled.
BTW I'm getting a bunch of other reports starting with 2.5.74 (see
"linux laptop keyboard problem since 2.5.74"). 
So let me get this straight -- because 2 machines require this patch,
you want all the OTHER machines to go on the blacklist? Shouldn't the 2
machines get special-cased?
All these machines work under Windows, so there has to be a solution
that enables everyone to work.
