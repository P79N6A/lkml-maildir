The main reason that I commented on this was because of your comment
below in the release emails,
Feel free to add new regressions/remove fixed etc.
http://kernelnewbies.org/known_regressions
And I was thinking, if these bugz need to transition over the bugzilla
anyway why not go straight there instead of via kernelnewbies .. People
would just get bugzilla accounts and open new bugz entry.
I not trying to force you into something , and ultimately it whatever is
easier for you.. Which was my main reason for commenting on it.

I think over time it would work like that , but I'm sure there's lots of
people who don't care about our bugzilla ..
