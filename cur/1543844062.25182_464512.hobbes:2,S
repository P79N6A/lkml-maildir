There's no problem with hiding per se, but rather with the indentation
level.  It's most natural for the user to have dependent options
indented under their "parent".  For an example, in "menuconfig" try
setting "Compile the kernel with frame unwind information";
notice that "Stack unwind support" appears immediately underneath
it, indented.  The indentation reminds the user why "Stack unwind
support" has appeared.
Note that several of the pre-existing, non-fault-injection options
under "Kernel debugging", are also broken in this way.
