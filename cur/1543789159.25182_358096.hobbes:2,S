I have a great deal of bad experience attempting to perform
emergency mounts on Sun Workstations that have this same
general scheme of un-typable:
../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0/sda/sda1
People need to enter this stuff without the help of cut-and-pase or
even a back-space that works. Are you trying to replace "/dev/sda1"
with the monster above? If so, you have way too much time on your
hands.
Of course if this is just some more stuff to be bloated into the
kernel and you don't even intend to use it, I shouldn't be
concerned, should I? Just keep that stuff away from "/dev". We
need to retain a sane interface.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
