An interrupt control line (bit) is set, and remains set until the
hardware that set the bit resets it. So, in a sense, all interrupts
are "level". However, the old PC/AT interrupt controller latches this
interrupt internally on the rising edge. Therefore, until the interrupt
controller is 'acked' this bit will remain set even if the hardware
has released it's control of the interrupt line. Latching of this
bit makes sure that no interrupts are "lost". However, such
edge-controlled interrupts don't allow sharing of an interrupt because
new edges are not detected until both the controller has been 'acked'
and the hardware stops driving the interrupt line.
To share interrupts, you need 'level' interrupts and the 8259 does
not normally do level interrupts. There is an extended mode register
to attempt to make it do level interrupts, but the rest of the hardware
usually prevents this from being workable. More on this later.

For experiments, of course, you can do anything you wish . However,
you do not want to mess with the software controlling the 8259 in the
kernel. The kernel software takes care of everything for you. Your ISR
is simply a 'C' procedure that the kernel will call when your hardware
interrupt occurs. Therefore, you do not program or even touch the
8259.

The 8259 cannot be used with level interrupts. This is because when
an interrupt line goes true, it is latched internally.

Shared interrupts must be level interrupts. You must use the APIC to
do this and, again, your software does not directly touch the APIC. The
kernel will handle everything for you.

On some motherboards, there is an "extended mode" register at
0x4d0 and 0x4d1. The high address is for the second controller
and the low address is for the first.
	76543210  IRQ
	||||||||_____________ 1 = level, 0 = edge
	|||||||______________ 1 = level, 0 = edge
	||||||_______________ 1 = level, 0 = edge
	|||||________________ 1 = level, 0 = edge
	||||_________________ 1 = level, 0 = edge
	|||__________________ 1 = level, 0 = edge
	||___________________ 1 = level, 0 = edge
	|____________________ 1 = level, 0 = edge
Again, mucking with these registers will hang the machine.
Many driver-writers attempt to make things more complicated than they
really are. Here is an ISR which only bumps an interrupt count. It
executes when IRQ7 (the printer port) status bit gets hit. A function
generator conected to this port will interrupt about 85,000 to 90,000
times per second without losing any interrupts. The printer port
doesn't have to be 'acked' so there's nothing to do there. Your
hardware probably has to be serviced to reset its interrupt
request.
static void device_isr(int irq, void *p, struct pt_regs *regs)
{
    INFO *inf = (INFO *) p;
    inf->intrs++;
}
Note there are no instructions to program the interrupt controller(s).
From a programmer's perspective, it's magic.
