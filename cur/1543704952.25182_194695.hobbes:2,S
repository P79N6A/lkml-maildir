I've seen plenty of reports from people who complain about IO APIC
breakage on VIA. It might be fixed in 2.6, but I wouldn't know since I
don't have any IO APIC hardware. Or maybe the reporters found it easier
to turn off that option than to get somebody to fix it. If 2.6 fails
as well I suggest you try bugzilla.kernel.org so at least the report
won't go away.
