sure for 2.5. However for 2.4 still I'm not very excited about those
optimizations getting in now, at least until some of the other more
important pending patches are included. I don't care if those
optimizations are obvious or not, it's just more work for Marcelo and I
prefer him to spend all his cpu time on things that matters, not on
unnecessary cleanups (at least until there will be pending things that
matters, if there aren't it's fine to work on
microoptimizations/cleanups), and nevertheless it would generate rejects
and more work for me too but I have ways that reduces my overhead,
so my reject solving work would be really my last concern.
