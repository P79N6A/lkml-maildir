I had a parsing error with your statement. My mind made the jump to "they are 
doing it with GPLv2 code" - meaculpa.

No need. Linus already understands the equation, and also the secondary fact 
that most home users are not developers. However, companies like TiVO do 
employ developers. This is why the equation works.

Actually you are in error here. You are saying "More home users == More 
Developers" when the ratio of home users to developers isn't all that high. 
(small set of facts: "Hacker" == "Developer" (in most cases, where the term, 
as defined in the Jargon File, can actually be applied), "Home User" * 0.10 
(ie: 10%) == "Developer" (approximately, and the correlation may be 
lower). "TiVO" == "Developers" (note the plural - they do employ more than 
one person for development))
So "TiVO", even though they are walking all over the freedoms you love, means 
more *guaranteed* developers than the potential pool from the users of their 
boxes. (the pool of potential developers among the millions of TiVO users is 
actually miniscule, despite the size of the sample)
However, you do make a good argument. But when you look at the statistics[1] 
they don't hold water.

I love that phrase!
But seriously, all I did was stop trying to give fully reasoned counters 
(complete with examples) and state the simple truth.
