Dear kernel hackers:
Just an observation with the latest kernel here. I previously had
problems compiling kernels (eg 2.4.19-rc2-ac2) *unless* both LOCAL-APIC
and IO-APIC were configured in. This is now solved, in that I can
compile with or without IO-APIC.
However, I just built 2.4.19-rc5 with them *both* selected, and it
wouldn't boot. My system is an Athlon XP / Abit KR7A mboard / Via KT266A
running RH 7.3 - am I doing something wrong?
I have now rebuilt with just LOCAL-APIC and without IO-APIC and it's
running like a baby :-)
Hope this is helpful....
Cheers
Alastair
