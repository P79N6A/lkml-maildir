hi all,
I am using kernel 2.6.0 with kde 3.2. Every once in a while, the system
fails to reboot or shutdown properly and i get something like this :
" unmount exited with preemt_count 2
unmounting filesystems (retry): "
and it just stops there. There were more lines before these but I dont
remember them (and there's no way i can reproduce the error, it doesn't
happen everytime i reboot or shutdown)
can someone give me a hint on what's happening here ?
thanks
