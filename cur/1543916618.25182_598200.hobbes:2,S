Subject: [PATCH#2 4/4] [POWERPC] Fix cpm_uart driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

in cpm_uart_cpm1.h, DPRAM_BASE is assigned an address derived from cpmp.
On ARC=ppc, this is a physical address with 1:1 DMA mapping which can't
be used for arithmetric compare operations with virtual addresses
returned by cpm_dpram_addr. This patch changes the assignment to use
cpm_dpram_addr as well, like in cpm_uart_cpm2.h.
