I don't understand it at all. I mean there is no other IO going
on so there would be no reason for the disk head to move anyway.
Rotational latency should be basically non-existant due to track
buffers, and being FC RAID hardware you wouldn't expect them to
skimp on anything.

Yes it definately has to be selectable (in fact, in my current
version, setting antic_expire = 0 disables it), and Andrew has
been working on tuning the non anticipatory version into shape.

It would be easy to anticipate or not based on hints. We could
anticipate sync writes if we wanted, lower expire time for sync
writes, increase it for async reads. It is really not very
complex (although the code needs tidying up).
