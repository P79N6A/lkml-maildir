If you're talking about write(2), it should be safe, since the entropy
count is not affected.  If you're talking about doing an ioctl(2) on
/dev/random, this is risky (since root can modify the entropy counter),
but it looks like all those code paths are protected by a capability
check, so my guess is that you're probably ok this, too.
