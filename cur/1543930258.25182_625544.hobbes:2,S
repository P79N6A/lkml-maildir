My guess is that Al is not really a developer (product management/ 
marketing?), what he has in mind is probably not an SCM but a backup  
system a la Mac's time machine or Netapp's snapshots that also  
support disconnected commits. I think that git could be a suitable  
engine for such systems, after a few tweaks to avoid compressing  
already compressed blobs like jpeg, mp3 and mpeg etc.
