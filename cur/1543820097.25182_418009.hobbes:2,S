Subject: Re: [v4l-dvb-maintainer] [PATCH] cx25840 driver in 2.6.16 -- adds CX25836 support

Hi Scott,
Thank you for your patch! Nice work. I've integrated it into the cx25840 
driver (with some tweaks).
Please check my mercurial tree at 
http://www.linuxtv.org/hg/~hverkuil/cx25836
 to see if my changes did 
not break anything for you. For the most part the changes dealt with 
preventing the cx25836/7 from touching cx25840-specific registers.
Please let me know if it is OK (or not) so that I can get it merged into 
the main v4l-dvb repository. I also need a Signed-off-by line from you 
(see 
http://www.linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/How_to_submit_patches
) 
before I can officially merge the code.
As I am also maintainer of ivtv I'm looking forward to your ivtv 
patches. Please contact me when you are seriously starting work on 
ivtv: work is in progress to merge ivtv into the kernel, and if you can 
let me know in advance what sort of changes you need, then I can warn 
you if the changes required for the kernel merge conflict with what you 
need.
And for the record, AFAIK there is no driver for the TI TLV320AIC23B.
Regards,
	Hans Verkuil
