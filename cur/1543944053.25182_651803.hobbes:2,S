Not sure I'm understanding your question, sorry.
Mempolicy modes have always been int constants because it doesn't make 
sense to combine them.  Putting them into 'enum mempolicy_mode' leaves 
that unchanged.
Mempolicy flags can be combined (even though my patchset only currently 
implements one, it's easy to implement others).  So they definitely cannot 
be enum constants.
Regardless, storing the policy (mode | flags) in struct mempolicy as a 
'short' doesn't help since a negative policy doesn't mean anything.  In 
preparation for allowing the upper MPOL_FLAG_SHIFT bits to be used to 
store the flags of this member, I converted it to 'unsigned short'.  This 
is because the API with userspace is through 'int', which is implicitly 
signed, and we don't want to sign-extend the upper bit if it's ever used 
to hold a mempolicy flag.
