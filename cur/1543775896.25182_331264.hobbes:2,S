Your binutils is probably too old and therefore buggy.  2.16 seems
reasonable, others prefer the known-buggy in other respects 2.15
version (iirc assembler doesn't complain about undefined constant
symbols, doesn't correctly hide $a, $d, $t symbols.)
The exact problem is the ASSERT() macro in the linker script - it
appears some versions of binutils are documented to accept this
but unfortunately it incorrectly errors out with a ficticious syntax
error.
