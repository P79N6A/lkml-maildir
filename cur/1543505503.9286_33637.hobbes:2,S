hi *,
before I again crash the filesystems here -- I tried to understand the diffs
between the different versions of linux that worked for me and failed for me
(2.2.7 worked, above failed, see my ~page for the complete story) but I
think I failed here.
Have there been problems found in the kernel that may have caused the fs go
bezerk ? or do I need to try it out ?
