I'm trying to get an existing SDK (userland) for a PCI hardware device
to work across a different propriatary bit-banged interface.
The original device driver just mmaped the PCI registers / address
space into userland.  (talk about lazy ;)
Anyway, the hardware I'm working with is *not* on the PCI bus, and
therefore not memory-mappable.  So, I'm stuck with a complex driver
design (compared to the original), and rewriting the entire bottom of
the SDK.
So, I thought:  Is there a way to cheat?  Would it be possible for me
to *fake* the SDK out by memory mapping some RAM, and then reading /
writing to the ram after bit-banging the device.
I looked into it some, but I couldn't figure out how to get notified
when the region was read/written to (only when the page changed).  So,
is it possible to do the (admitedly ugly) hack I'm attempting?
Thanks in advance,
-Dave
