yeah, you are right.
static int __init parse_memopt(char *p)
{
        u64 mem_size;
        if (!p)
                return -EINVAL;
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_32
        if (!strcmp(p, "nopentium")) {
                setup_clear_cpu_cap(X86_FEATURE_PSE);
                return 0;
        }
#endif
        userdef = 1;
        mem_size = memparse(p, &p);
        e820_remove_range(mem_size, ULLONG_MAX - mem_size, E820_RAM, 1);
        return 0;
}
early_param("mem", parse_memopt);
in x86 we use that param analyser much later ( after we check the e820 table..)
other cpu flag will be overwrite too..
anyway, this patch is not go through x86 tip..., some strange!
