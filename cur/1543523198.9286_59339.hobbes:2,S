Subject: 2.3.x, FS corruption?

Hello linux-kernel fans,
I've noticed, when I'm running either plain vanilla 2.3.39 or 2.3.40, upgrading
a pile of debian packages thru apt (download via ftp, temporary spooling of
the .deb in /var/apt/cache, then bulk installation of each .deb), the
apt software stop on an error, due to a corruption of a freshly installed
package file list (a file containing the full path of each file installed by
a particular package).
It may be apt or dpkg which are broken, but the thing is I've never had
such a corruption with 2.2.x, only 2.3.x
Hmmm I'm compiling my kernel with:
Linux version 2.3.40 (root@leeloo) (gcc version 2.95.2 19991109 (Debian GNU/Linux)) #1 Sun Jan 23 01:23:18 CET 2000
Here's one such corrupted file:
hexdump -c /var/lib/dpkg/info/smsclient.list
(I'm using 4096 bytes block size on ext2)
(notice the corrupted garbage take just the first 4096 bytes of the file.
After that it's the normal text file).
