.code16gcc has been in production use in real projects since at least 2001.
16-bit code produced by gcc is indeed, guaranteed to not work on pre-386
x86s, but so is the code we had there before.  Saying "before switching
to protected mode you have to think about [the] cpu as a pre-80386" is
blatantly false; 32-bit registers and addressing are readily available
in real mode using size override prefixes (which is what ".code16gcc"
takes care of.)

You're saying "I don't understand it, and it scares me."  The
differences compared to standard .code16 are pretty minute, mostly in
the matter of a couple of different default sizes (e.g. "call" defaults
to "calll" not "callw".)

... and the code is an utter, unmaintainable mess.
