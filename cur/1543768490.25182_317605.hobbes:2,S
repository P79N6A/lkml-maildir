Subject: [PATCH 4/4] iseries_veth: Cleanup skbs to prevent unregister_netdevice() hanging
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew, Jeff,
The iseries_veth driver is badly behaved in that it will keep TX packets
hanging around forever if they're not ACK'ed and the queue never fills up.
This causes the unregister_netdevice code to wait forever when we try to take
the device down, because there's still skbs around with references to our
struct net_device.
There's already code to cleanup any un-ACK'ed packets in veth_stop_connection()
but it's being called after we unregister the net_device, which is too late.
The fix is to rearrange the module exit function so that we cleanup any
outstanding skbs and then unregister the driver.
