How this started was that with the latest git linux, I got this warning ...
warning: `named' uses 32-bit capabilities (legacy support in use)
So, I recompile named and ended up with the "capset failed" problem. I
tried compiling linux with LSM, but that didn't help.
Adding "--disable-linux-caps" to named compile solved the problem.
Thanks,
Jeff.
