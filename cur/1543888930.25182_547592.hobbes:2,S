But you always lacked a transition plan and never showed a decent API if memory
serves, your methods disregarded back compat usually.
also there is no need to port all drivers there never has been we need
to just add config options and work with distros to upgrade to the
newer bits..
As Jesse  said this is an RFC we are not merging it in the morning
however all your comments are hand waving so far we need technical
problems with this API.
Dave.
