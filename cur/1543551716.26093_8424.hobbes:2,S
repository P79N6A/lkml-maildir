Interesting concept, linking a module with libg++.  Would that be a
dynamic or static link?
If it is dynamic then you can absolutely forget about loading the
module into the kernel, there is no way that modutils will ever support
that.  If it is a static link then every module has its own private
copy of libg++, that would introduce more than a little kernel bloat.
How big is a static copy of libg++ these days?  The thought of two or
more modules each with a static copy of libg++ but running in the same
kernel address space gives me the shivers.
So even if you can compile a module with C++ headers and link against
libg++, it is extremely unlikely that you could load it.  If you cannot
load it, why bother compiling it with C++?
