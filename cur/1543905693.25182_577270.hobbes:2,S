Legitimate emotional reaction for being locked out of the development
process. There's a very human aspect to this, yes, a negative human
aspect that pervade Linux kernel development and is overly defensive and
protective of new ideas.

That's highly inaccurate and rather disrespect of Con's experience.
There as a policy decision made with SD that one person basically didn't
like, this person whined like a baby for the a formula bottle and didn't
understand how to use "nice" to control this inherent behavior of this
scheduler.
