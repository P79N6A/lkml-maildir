| Yes, that's true.
or maybe it's just difficult to tell which subsystem has a problem...

| The way I imagine it working would be that you could assign it to

| was more likely to get solved anyway, so you are, in effect, balancing
| out the attention it gets).
|
| In the case you point out, as it's primarily networking and USB, the
| bug would get assigned to Andrew Morton, Jeff Garzik, and Greg
| Kroah-Hartman, who would all be relevant people to contact.
Hm, I see this problem as more of a generic interrupt routing or ACPI
problem, not networking or USB.

| Good point.

Do we have anyone targeted for interrupt routing problems (PIC, IO APIC,
ACPI, etc.)?
