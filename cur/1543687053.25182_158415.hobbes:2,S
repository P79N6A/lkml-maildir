You enlarge your journal (larger for more activity).
The idea is that the sync puts all data+meta-data into the journal, and once
that's complete the sync returns.
After the sync returns, the data is written from the journal asyncrounously
in the background while you're not waiting.
If your system is stressed to its limit, this won't work, but in the common
case, it will speed up your nfs server.
Though, after using reiserfs for a while, writeout is smoother.  There
aren't the spikes like with ext3 (even in ordered mode), but that could be
due to the 30 second timeout on reiserfs compared to 5 second for ext3
before writes are committed to disk (without memory pressure).
