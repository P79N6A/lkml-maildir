Ah, you mean that I need to turn off UDP checksum on receive end as well 
in IPv6...  true.
For those interested, I am dealing with a UDP app that already does very 
strong checksumming and encryption, so additional software checksumming 
at the lower layers is quite simply a waste of CPU cycles.  Hardware 
checksumming is fine, as long as its "free."
