That's not quite true, you _can_ change the memory map by issuing
concurrent mmap/munmap/mremap etc.. calls from another thread.
The thing is, afaik futexes have never been completely safe wrt
concurrent mm modifications -- that is, as long as we fail the futex op
with -EFAULT or similar and not crash the kernel we're good.

Yes, so when we assume the mmap stable (and fail the op whenever that
assumption proves false) we can say the futex keys are stable and should
never need recomputation.
