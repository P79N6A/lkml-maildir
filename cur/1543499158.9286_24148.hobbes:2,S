I would suggest you consider the patch-kernel script located in
linux/scripts.  It has syntax of patch-kernel sourcedir patchdir, and
has the advantage that it can handle multiple patches.  If, for example,
you start with a 2.2.0 tarball and download all the patches up to
2.2.10 it will do it all in one easy step.
