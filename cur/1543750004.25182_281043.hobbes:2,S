Ignore all of the Warning messages (for now) and focus
on the Error message (above).
I don't find DENTRY_UNUSED_THRESHOLD in any .h or .c
or DocBook/* file in linux-2.6.5 (or current), but
maybe they are in your source tree.  Please check
and report where and then we'll see if it needs
to be fixed (or already is fixed).
