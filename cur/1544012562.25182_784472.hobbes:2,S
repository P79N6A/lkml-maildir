Yes, please.  For people hacking on different architectures occasionally
the current setup with per-arch ops (and sometimes none at all) is pain.

Also the calgary iommu is very similar to those used on some pseries
machines, but I'd have to look at the code if the interface actually
still is similar, or if the PPC firmware adds too much abstractions
inbetween.
Also the older IA64 altixens have a slightly updated version of the
iommu used on MIPS IP27 (and the same as on MIPS IP35 which we'll
hopefully support one day)
