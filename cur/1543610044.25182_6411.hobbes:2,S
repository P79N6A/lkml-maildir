The mail server was down for over 9 hours today.  Suffice to say if 
you are using RedHat Seawolf with Sendmail 8.11.X you need to upgrade 
to 8.12.00 and enable UseMSP=Yes and set up the indirect submission
methods for smmsp:smmsp.  I used tcpdump and determined that IE6 will 
send "hidden" emails to addresses at msn.com (they appeared random).  I 
have no idea why it is doing this, but these emails appeared to contain 
system level information.  There was also obvious (and very nasty) packet 
corruption from IE6 that sendmail 8.11.X does not handle very well at all
whe it gets these corrupted packets.  
Mail server up.  IE6 in the trash can.  We'll try this one at a later date.
Need to warn Linux users that IE6 is severely broken and can result in 
severe crashes on Linux systems.  It also caused a W2K server to crash and 
blue screen as well today.  My mail server was non-functional for most 
of the afternoon due to IE6 mail clients in the building periodically 
causing email flood storms on Seawolf with Sendmail 8.11.X and Linux 
2.4.14.
