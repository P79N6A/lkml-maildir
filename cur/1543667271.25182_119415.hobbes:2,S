Well, if you're not getting good docs from SiS I commend you on your abilities.
My P4S533 (SiS645DX chipset) is doing decently well with a Maxtor ATA/133 100G
drive. It's only a 5400rpm drive and nearly matches the 120G WD ATA/100 7200rpm
in my Dell for hdparm speeds. I was a little disappointed in the speed 
comparisons till I saw that you're doing this blind.
Thanks.
