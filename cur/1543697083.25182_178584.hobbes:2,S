Hi
Within drivers/message/i2o/README it states that the Intel SCU cards
failed testing for the i2o driver due to the card "hanging under certain
load patterns" (at least for 2.4.18ac3).
I've been unable to find any details as to the load patterns that causes
this behaviour (in fact there's little information anywhere on this) -
can anyone shed any light on the conditions that cause the card to hang?
TIA
Graeme
