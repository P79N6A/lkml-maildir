Probably an old fdformat?
Try a recent util-linux.
[I forgot the details - people will correct me -
Old situation: a special kludge in floppy.c allows ioctls,
including formatting, on a fd opened without read or write
permission. And the old fdformat did just that.
Some cleanup removed the kludge, and fdformat had to open
the fd for writing. So the util-linux fdformat was updated.
Later Alain Knaff said that the old kludge remained necessary,
because one might wish to use ioctl's on write protected floppies.
Maybe the change was partially reverted, I have not checked.]
