OK, thanks.
I don't think this necessarily tells us where the bug lies.  It could be
some pre-existing thing in MSI, or it could be added by Bryce's changes. 
Or by Eric's.  Or, of course, by
genirq-convert-the-i386-architecture-to-irq-chips.patch.
There doesn't seem to be a lot of movement on this and we want to get the
x86 genirq conversion into 2.6.19.  Could be that we end up having to merge
known-buggy stuff into mainline and crash enough computers to irritate
someone into fixing it.  Rather sad.
