 Interrupt transfers, like isochronous transfers, are periodic, and happen
 in intervals that are powers of two (1, 2, 4 etc) units.  Units are frames
 for full and low speed devices, and microframes for high speed ones.

-Currently, after you submit one interrupt URB, that urb is owned by the

-After a transfer completion is called, the URB is automagically resubmitted.

-Interrupt transfers may only send (or receive) the "maxpacket" value for

-copy that data out of (or into) another buffer.  Similarly, you can't

 The usb_submit_urb() call modifies urb->interval to the implemented interval
 value that is less than or equal to the requested interval value.
