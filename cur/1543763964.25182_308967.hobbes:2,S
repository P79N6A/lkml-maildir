ofcourse i did. I just think that ulimit (or other userspace tools)
should be used to *raise* the limit if you need more. Not the reverse.

I already suggested ulimit solutions for my distro. They think that if
this is needed the kernel dev's would do something (ie its a kernel
problem) while the kernel dev's says this is a userspace prob.
I wouldn't bother if this was a problem for one or two distros only.
Now, almost all distros seems to be vulnerable by default.
I wouldn't bother if other *nixes would set this limit in userspace.
(the BSD's set the limit lower in kernel and let users who need more
raise with userland tools)
I wouldn't bother if this wouldn't give Linux a bad reputation.
I'm Sorry if I made some people upset.
