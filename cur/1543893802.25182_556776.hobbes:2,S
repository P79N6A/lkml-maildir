I missed you saying that before, so to me it looked like everyone just
assumed that.
So, just for fun, I tried running:
while true; do setleds +num; setleds -num; done
and it totally locked up my keyboard. Even SysRq didn't work. On the
bright side, the numlock LED was indeed blinking. Though running the
same with a sleep 0.1 added doesn't produce any problems. So maybe
my problem is indeed a bit related to this after all, somehow. Anyone
any ideas how to debug this problem?
