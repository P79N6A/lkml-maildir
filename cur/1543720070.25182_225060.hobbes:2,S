In that case the cpumask code should provide some API function which
converts a cpumask_t into (and from?) some canonical and documented form. 
Then you copy what it gave you to userspace.
Particular pieces of code shouldn't go poking inside the cpumask_t's
representation.  It's different on different architectures and we could
even change it in the future.
