Unfortunately, not _all_. DMRAID does not support all fake raids yet. Moreover, there is usually
some gap for bleeding edge hw support.

  This is not really relevant. They actually answer it right in the article - BIOS extensions, aka
EDD.
  I'd say the performance issue is more in int13 non-dma vs. dma data transfers, and tricks
associated with vm86. Although most 'on board' BIOSes support dma just fine for single drives,
faik raid and 'plug-in' card option ROMS usually lacks any dma support. Plus, there is no way to
tell whether BIOS will do dma or pio upfront.
  Another problem here is that BIOSes usually support legacy PIC interrupt model, and modern OSes
use IO APIC and resteer the interrups.
