  Apparently it must be appropriate, because that's pretty natural
and clean - if you can pass data, why wouldn't you be able to pass
methods?
  I assume your usecase is to pass board-specific code, defined in
machine definition, down to a device driver. We (handhelds.org) go
even further and recently tried passing function pointers in opposite
direction - from device driver to client code which will use the
device, via device's platform_data.
  That essentially implements virtual methods on devices, allowing
device clients to perform operations on them without bothering to know
how actually the operation is implemented, i.e. offers better
functionality separation and code reuse which OOP offers.
  Either way, be assured that you're not the only one who puts Linux
Driver Model under full use.
