Subject: Why isn't this a bug in run_bottom_halves() (2.2.5)?

(I'm not subscribed to the list, so CC me on replies if you want, but
I plan to follow the discussion using DejaNews either way.  Thanks.)
Looking at the 2.2.5 kernel, I saw what seems to be a bug in
run_bottom_halves().  The big fat comment describes my thinking:
static inline void run_bottom_halves(void)
{
        unsigned long active;
        void (**bh)(void);
        active = get_active_bhs();
/*
 * Interrupts are enabled here.  So suppose an interrupt occurs when
 * we're right here and its top half marks a previously unmarked
 * bottom half.  do_IRQ() won't execute run_bottom_halves() after
 * servicing the new interrupt's top half because we already have the
 * lock for run_bottom_halves(), but when we return to this point, we
 * zero bh_active in the next line, so the newly marked BH never gets
 * run.  I know we don't promise to service BHs right away (that's the
 * point), but we shouldn't overlook them entirely, right?
 */
        clear_active_bhs(active);
        bh = bh_base;
        do {
                if (active & 1)
                        (*bh)();
                bh++;
                active >>= 1;
        } while (active);
}
This looks like it would be a really obvious bug, so I'd think it
would have been fixed long ago if there really were a bug here.  On
the other hand, I don't understand where my analysis went wrong.  Any
insight?
