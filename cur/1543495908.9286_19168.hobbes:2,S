I don't know if this would satisfy dosemu, but...
mmap() on /proc/self/mem could act on whatever is already mapped.
If a file is mapped in the area, you get an extra copy, etc.
Let's say you have this...
40000000-40009000 r-xp 00000000 03:07 28750      /lib/ld-2.0.7.so
40009000-4000b000 rw-p 00008000 03:07 28750      /lib/ld-2.0.7.so
4000b000-4000e000 r--p 00000000 03:07 4146       /etc/ld.so.cache
4000e000-4009f000 r-xp 00000000 03:07 28754      /lib/libc-2.0.7.so
4009f000-400a6000 rw-p 00090000 03:07 28754      /lib/libc-2.0.7.so
...and you mmap() bytes 40000000-400a6000 of /proc/self/mem. That ought
to get you another 5 mappings, as above, with new addresses.
