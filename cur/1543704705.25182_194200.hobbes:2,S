Subject: ACPI versus VIA IDE controller?

I know there has been a problem getting the VIA ide controller
to cooperate with ACPI, but I saw a bunch of acpi changes coming
from Linus today so I reenabled acpi in my 2.6.2-rc2 again just
out of curiosity.
I still see the message about the VIA ide controller:
ACPI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 0000:00:11.1 -
using IRQ 255
I haven't exercised the machine much, but it all seems to be
working just fine so far.
Are there any known risks to running the machine in this mode?
