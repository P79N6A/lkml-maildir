My initial reaction was mostly due to the look of the code, which is
fixable.  I also don't like carrying around bits of libc (although we
do have setjmp/longjmp, but that's a special case).  However, it's
unlikely that it will need much maintenance, so this is more a taste
thing as well.

I think I still like the two-stage thing better.  If the 'which' part
finds something that doesn't exec, then we can just spit out a nice error.

I was envisioning it being part of bootup, but doing it just before
the exec would be OK, too.
