Oh, I agree with that.  There is no doubt of that, I thought that was fairly
apparent.  We aren't arguing about "what" we are arguing about "how".  You
are saying "I can take the path explored before and do it better" and I'm
saying "Maybe, but extremely unlikely given history.  It's far more likely
that you'll repeat history by ignoring it, a time honored tradition, albeit
ill-advised."
