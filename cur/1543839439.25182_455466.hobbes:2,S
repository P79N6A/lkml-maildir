I guess this one still needs some work. We already have a bottom
half mechanism in the network layer, using the NAPI poll function
that is strongly serialized.
Linas, you wrote that you have tried doing the TX descriptor cleanup
in dev->poll(), but I think you missed the point that this function
needs should then be scheduled whenever necessary.
This seems a little strange, but I think what we need to do is in the
low-watermark interrupt call netif_rx_schedule(netdev) in order to
arrange for the ->poll function to be called in the next softirq.
Someone should probably document that in 
Documentation/networking/NAPI_HOWTO.txt, I might end up doing that
once we get it right for spidernet.
