Hi,
Hiroto Shibuya wrote to tell me that he has a VIA EPIA-EK10000
which suffers from the reboot problem when no keyboard is attached.
My first patch works for him :
  
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=59f4e7d572980a521b7bdba74ab71b21f5995538
But the latest patch does not work for him :
  
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=8b93789808756bcc1e5c90c99f1b1ef52f839a51
We found that it was necessary to also set the "disable keyboard"
flag in the command byte, as the first patch was doing.  The
second patch tries to minimally modify the command byte, but
it is not enough.
Please consider this simple one-line patch to help people with
low end VIA motherboards reboot when no keyboard is attached.
Hiroto Shibuya has verified that this works for him (as I
no longer have an afflicted machine) :
