Subject: readv() return and errno

 In doing some testing on the project I'm working on I came
 across something that is causing a bit of confusion on my part.
 According to readv(2) EINVAL is returned for an invalid
 argument.  The examples given were count might be greater than
 MAX_IOVEC or zero. The test case I am working with has count = 0
 and I get return of 0 and errno 0 instead of the expected -1
 and errno EINVAL.
 Am I missing something?
Thanks!
