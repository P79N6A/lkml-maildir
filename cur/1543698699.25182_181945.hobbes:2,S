Andrea, your vm does not work correctly in any cases.
It's so simple. I've tried to fill up my memory with that crappy khexedit that comes with kde2. You'll see how my memory fills with the contents of the whole file I load. When I have started 2 or 3 instances of khexedit my memory was nearly completely filled. Than I tried to start another khexedit (with a file that should nearly fit into memory), and the pain began.

Ok. Could you please describe what your vm really does here in my specific case ?
Rick's old vm worked better. It'd have killed the task that had last allocated memory.
PS: If you need more details it should be no problem to do this again.
