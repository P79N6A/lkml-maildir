We're calling smp_call_function() with local interrupts disabled, which is
deadlockable.
This, I expect, is because swsusp_suspend() optimistically tries to run
everything with local interrupts disabled.
I don't know why this has suddenly started happening -
timekeeping_resume()->clock_was_set()->on_each_cpu() has been there for a
while.  Doesn't mainline do the same thing?
Not sure what to do about this.  The best fix would be to teach swsusp to
not be so optmistic: resume functions are called with local irqs _enabled_
- that's part of their call environment.  swsusp tries to call them with
local irqs disabled and bad things happen.
