I found that if you use schedule() directly then the sleeping
task appears to be spinning in "system" in `top`. If you use
schedule_timeout(0), it works the same, but doesn't appear
to be eating CPU cycles as shown by `top`. Many common
drivers need to have the timeout interruptible, but wait
<forever if necessary> for a particular event. They need
to get the CPU back fairly often to check again for the
event. They need the equavalent of user-mode sched_yield().
sys_sched_yield() did't seem to work correctly, last time
I tried.
Maybe somebody could make a sched_yield() for the kernel.
That would improve a lot of drivers.
