But you already _told_ kbuild that mac80211/ would contain a built-in.o
using following statement in drivers/net/wireless/Makefile:
obj-y += mac80211/
Changing this to obj-$(CONFIG_IWLWIFI) += mac80211/ would
give kbuild the _correct_ info.
obj-m += dir/
tell kbuild this directory contains a module so it will descend and build
obj-y += dir/
tall kbuild that directory contains stuff to be built-in and _maybe_ a module so
it will descend and build.
Note that when kbuild has entered a subdirectory it has lost knowledge of _how_
it came there so if you have lied to kbuild it will not detect it.
So in your case you told kbuild that there is stuff to be build in
in the mac80211/ dir which was incorrect.
