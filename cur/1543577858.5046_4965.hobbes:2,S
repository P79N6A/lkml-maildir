IMO, pump is a POS.  I have had more complaints from others and troubles
with it personally than I care to acknowledge.  dhcpcd has worked great for
me for as long as I can recall.  dhclient also seems to work just fine.
I've used all of these from 2.2 on through 2.3 and currently using dhcpcd
and dhclient with 2.4 on tulips and 3coms.
