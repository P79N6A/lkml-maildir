Hello,
I've built a module I'm trying to run on various (2.2.x) levels of the
kernel.  I compiled the module against a 2.2.18 Source Tree.  I strip out
the __module_kernel_version symbol and re-link the module on the target
system to get the __module_kernel_version symbol in it.  My problem is that
I cannot run the module on any version of the kernel other than the version
the module was compiled against without getting a slew of unresolved
symbols.  Can anyone please provide a little advice?
Thanks!
Chris
