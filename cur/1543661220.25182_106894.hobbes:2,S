Maybe the native machine endianness is used for performace reasons -
that would make sense given the typical uses of cramfs.  Also, it is a
read-only filesystem, so a userland application could flip the
endianness if a filesystem needs to be used on a non-native endianness
machine.
I'm not necessarily saying that that it's not a bug, just suggesting
an explaination.
John.
