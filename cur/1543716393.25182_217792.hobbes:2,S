And after 8 after/befores, the login appears again. The delay is after
the "before".
In the strace logs I can see a lot of alarms() and read(3,...). Note: fd
3 corresponds to /var/run/utmp
A bit of the log
02:11:08.850311 alarm(1)                = 0
02:11:08.850345 fcntl64(3, F_SETLKW, {type=F_RDLCK, whence=SEEK_SET,
start=0, len=0}) = 0
02:11:08.850386 read(3,
"\7\0\0\0\7\2\0\0tty9\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 384) = 384

I don't know where to look at the getty version, but I'm using Debian
Sid with util-linux=2.12-6 (the package which contains getty)
Something curious: I have just discovered that:
tuxland:~/gettylog# ps aux | grep tty9
root       998  0.0  0.1  2080  712 tty4     R    02:25   0:00 grep tty9
tuxland:~/gettylog# last | head
koke     tty9                          Sun May  2 02:24    gone - no logout
koke     tty9                          Sun May  2 02:11 - 02:24  (00:12)
