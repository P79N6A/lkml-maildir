This fixes the worst cases. Even the common case should somehow reflect 
that the relative start time should be rounded up in the same way (even 
if not by that much), e.g. due to rounding the current get_time() (at 
least for the non TIME_INTERPOLATION case) has a 1usec resolution, which 
should be added there.
