The problem is that the old getrlimit() syscall returns a max of 0x7fffffff
for the limit, while the kernel uses 0xffffffff for unlimited, so if you
do "setrlimit(getrlimit())" you may actually be going from a real unlimited
ulimit, to a "bogus" unlimited limit that the kernel will deny you on.
I think the fix is to simply ignore file limits when writing to block
devices.
Cheers, Andreas
