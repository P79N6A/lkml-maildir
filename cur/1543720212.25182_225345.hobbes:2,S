William, Anton:
If William recoded his bitmap_to_u32_array() routine, provided elsewhere
on this thread, to take as the length argument 'nwords', not the number
of source u64 words, but rather the number (possibly an odd number) of
u32 dest words, then could that routine be used to significantly simply
this compat_sched_getaffinity() code?
