Subject: [PATCH 2/3] fix page-becoming-writable vm_page_prot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/13/151

The do_wp_page page_mkwrite breakage went unnoticed because do_no_page
was as usual giving write permission to the pte in handling a read fault
on a shared writable mapping, thus sneaking around page_mkwrite.
It could likewise be evaded by do_file_page->populate->install_page.  And
if those were to write protect the pte, mprotect back and forth could be
used to reinstate write permission without going through page_mkwrite.
No explicit change to those: deal with it by using the vm_page_prot
of a private mapping on any shared mapping which has a page_mkwrite.
