Nikita, would you confirm that the default fibration is to sort all 
files with '.' as the penultimate character by their last character 
first and then by the rest of the name in the usual lexicographic order? 
(If that is not the default, then please make it the default.)
Also, please note that the URL you supplied does not yet describe the 
fibration plugin and its available settings.  Please correct that on Monday.
