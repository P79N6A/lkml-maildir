I fixed up the dependencies on stuff in scripts/ and all the Config.in 
files, so I could take a clean tree and run make config. 
The kbuild-2.4 make dep didn't find any C files so didn't do much -
kbuild-2.5 would be a more useful base for such a game. I ignored the lack
of dependencies and went on to 'make vmlinux', at which point it started
trying to include header files from /usr/include/linux because they weren't
present in the kernel tree and we don't build with -nostdinc.
Extracting the information about what include files we need to get from 
SCCS is a difficult problem.
