Sleeping has many problems, but it also has one great advantage:
it's relatively easy to understand and doesn't need much extra
code (if any) in the user.
Also, I wouldn't expect lock interdependencies to be a major
problem at the level of something removing all traces of itself
(e.g. a driver module unregistering itself). Or would you happen
to know some example where such problems are happening ?

Something like:
	foo_schedule_destruction(&whatever);
	while (foo_lookup(whatever.name))
		yield();
Usually too ugly to consider for anything but desperate cases.

Yes, separating unlink (quick, non-blocking, always succeeds) and
destruction (slow, may run nethack, fragile) clearly has some appeal.

There's also the difference that the version using a callback would
schedule the removal, while the version returning an error would do
nothing (unless the caller tries again).
You could also do both, but that gets pretty difficult to use.

Nicely illustrates the problem of the "can look around one corner,
but not two" property of things like try_module_get, yes.
I'd also expect many cases of multiple devices which are serviced by
the same driver to have the same sort of problems. E.g. I'm pretty
sure I committed a few such sins in the ATM code, too.

Raising the general awareness of such problems is exactly what I'm
trying to accomplish here :-) By the way, also the argument "it may
be broken but it has never failed so far" is getting weaker with
the emergence of technologies that change relative code path
lengths, like hyperthreading.
