I don't think so.  Even in kernel 2.4, poll_wait() just calls
__pollwait().  I don't see anything in __pollwait() that sleeps.
Think about it.  How would the kernel handle userspace calling poll()
with more than one file descriptor if each individual driver slept?
I'll repeat my earlier suggestion.  Read the description of "poll and
select" in LDD:

If you refuse to understand the documented interface, I don't think
anyone can help you.
