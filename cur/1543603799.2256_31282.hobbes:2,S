Nope.  It's possible to get swapoff durations of many minutes,
but I don't think similar problems with unmount have been reported.
Is there any disk activity?  ps and top output?  Any theories?
BTW: I'm faintly surprised to hear that ext3 actually works in
2.4.11-pre4.  Quite a lot of things with which ext3 has an intimate
relationship were changed....
