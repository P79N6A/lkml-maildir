So the system will boot at ATA100, for example, and if errors are seen,
downgrade step by step until a satisfactory level is reached.  Perhaps, ATA66
or ATA33 and the system would continue proper operation still at a "somewhat
fast" (as compared to PIO) speed level AND in DMA mode, not PIO.  My situation
with the 6.31 driver has DMA being disabled by the driver when errors are
seen, as I think you have clearly stated.
?? I'm assuming no to this, but I'm curious: Is there any chance the driver
would "speed up" the transfers?  Ie: after a period of time at ATA33, would it
try ATA66, 100 again?  I suppose this makes more sense for things like
serial/modem communications where problems could come and go, but if one is
experiencing problems between the ATA circuitry, cable and drive, they'll
start good, get worse and never recover..?
