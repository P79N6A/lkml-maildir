Subject: Kernel 2.1.131 doesn't finish booting

	I just recieved 4 new machines.  They're dual Pentium II's with
128 Megs of RAM and SCSI with an Adaptec AIC-7881U controller.  There's
some cheap ATI video card in it as well.
	I installed RedHat 5.2 and then downloaded 2.1.131 and compiled
it.  When I rebooted, everything started up fine, but then, when it got to
this line:
Freeing unused kernel memory: 44k freed
	I got right after:
Warning: Unable to open an initial console
Kernel panic: No init found.  (Try passing init= as an option to the
kernel.)
	(Or something like that for the last line.)  Anyway, I tried
passing init=/sbin/init, but it didn't work.  (As I expected.)  
	Here is my configuration: (Sorry for putting all of it, but who
knows... I didn't want to miss something important.)
