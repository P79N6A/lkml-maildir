Interesting.  I'll see if I can find a spare machine to try installing
FC1 on tomorrow then, see if I can figure this one out.  I can't think
how this could happen, though.

Sorry if I was narky.  I tried to do the right thing and get more of
execshield in, rather than just what I needed, but it seems I screwed up
somewhere.  With the Wesnoth 1.2 feature freeze next week, my spare time
