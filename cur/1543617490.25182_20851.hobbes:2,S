I've seen this line various times, and I know the details are available
elsewhere, but the verbosity of this is inconsistent with the rest of
your entries. "Networking updates" can be bugfix, compatibility fix,
policy change, whatever; may I ask that you include some information to
the nature of these "Networking updates" please or, alternatively, send
an URL to the corresponding "Networking updates" ChangeLog?
Thanks a lot.
Also, do you plan to integrate Andre's IDE patches soon? Is it scheduled
for e. g. 2.4.19-pre1?
