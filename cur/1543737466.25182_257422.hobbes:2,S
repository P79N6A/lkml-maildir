PGP actually uses a similiar techinique (80 bits of randomness, with bytes 9+10
being repeats of 7+8) to check for bad decrypts. With 16 bits of checksum, the
attacker only is able to eliminate about (2^16-1)/2^16 of the keys, which seems
like a lot, but only reduces the keylength by 16 bits. If you're using
reasonably sized keys (>=128 bits) that's not a problem because the remaining
keyspace is still much larger than the set of likely passphrases (even quite
good passphrases rarely get over 80 or 90 bits of entropy).
