This more general than just the platform bus. It's how the Linux 2.6
device driver model is designed.
There are alternatives to the way hdaps and thinkpad_acpi instantiate
their devices:
* These drivers use DMI to find out whether they run on supported
hardware. The same detection code could be moved to a separate driver
(possibly the same one for all DMI-detected devices) and that separate
driver would instantiate the devices as needed. Then the usual
hotplug/coldplug rules apply.
* Detection could be moved to user-space entirely, then we would only
need a way to instantiate these specific devices from user-space. This
exists in other areas (scsi, network) for quite some times already so
it shouldn't be too difficult.

Sounds like you have a design issue here to start with. Supporting
several significantly different devices in the same module is not
something that we do usually.
