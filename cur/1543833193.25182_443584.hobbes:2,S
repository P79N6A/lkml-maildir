Sounds like a worn bearing or a head crash.

I've seen disks where the 100s timeout is not enough and which only
came into a useful state after 10 minutes or even longer. Your patch
would make those disks useless, even though they can be used. Also I'm
not sure your patch is the right approach: a disk doesn't have
removable media and yet it reports that there's no media present.
