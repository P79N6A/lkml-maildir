Well the API change intercepts both kmap/kunmap and
kmap_atomic/kunmap_atomic; it's designed to be agnostic to the _atomic
bit (I just wrote kmap/kunmap in the Subject line because I was saving
letters).  Since it's intended as a flushing API, it has no context
issues, so the parisc implementation is the similar for both (the only
difference being the return value).
However, while kmap exists, it also has to be intercepted for this
approach to work...
