Hm, it does look very odd.  It looks like it has something to
do with <choice> working differently for some reason.
In xconfig, I set all of the View Options and when I click on one
of the periph. controllers, it says
	depends on =y && PCI
but if I back up to -git7, it says
	depends on <choice> && PCI
I'll keep looking.
