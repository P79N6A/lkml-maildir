Sorry that's not true (#1), it's _never_ valid for IDE_DMA to be set
here even when using TCQ (less so, if possible, for non-tcq :-). At
least according to the old semantics. That's only the case when using
speculative starts of the dma engine for tcq with release interrupt
enabled, which we don't use on Linux.
