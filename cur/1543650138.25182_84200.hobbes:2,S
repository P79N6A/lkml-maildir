Currently,  for net events, notifier_call_chain() calls from the same
routines which also send netlink announcements. I am thinking actually
having notifier_call_chain make the netlink advertisements.
There are not that many subsystems that use notifier block calls (seems
the network subsytem is their best customer ;->)
i think it is the best async notification scheme in the kernel. Too bad
someone had to invent hotplug the way it is right now.
As i said earlier, the advantage with netlink is that you could easily
add a distributed event notification scheme since it is already in packet
format.
