For some reason, ftpd left some garbage in my ftp directory:
 227329 drwxr-xr-x   3 ftp      ftp          1024 Sep  6 13:37

This is a tree of directories (I don't know how deep it goes) (I ran ls -li),
some of the entries appear to be blank (i.e. in fr I get /////)
What tool/metholodgies/reading to you recommend?  (I essentially want to
do rm -rf by inode number).
(I've fscked the disk and it fsck's clean).
