How would you do it without flag day?

IIRC, Christoph mentioned:
	irq_flags_t flags;
	flags = spin_lock_irqXXX(&lock);
	spin_unlock_irqYYY(&lock, flags);
where XXX and YYY are still to be found good names :^) It's also a solution
without flag day and with more sane lock part -- "how flags are modified
if they are passed by value?"
I start to like this proposal but I can't come up with good names.
