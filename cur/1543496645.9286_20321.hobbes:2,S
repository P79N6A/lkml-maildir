Hello:
I'm building a linux server here using Caldera OpenLinux 2.2 (2.2.5
kernel) and have 2 questions:
1) Is the Adaptec 2910B PCI SCSI card  supported and if so what kernel
option needs to be compiled in...I didn't see an obvious one....
2) IS the 3Com 3C509B-TXNM 10/100MB PCI Ethernet card supported and
again which is the appropriate option to pick....
I've tried the obvious ones here and have had no success, thanks for
any help you can give.
George
