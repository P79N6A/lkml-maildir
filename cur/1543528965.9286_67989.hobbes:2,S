	Good move, I rewally do appreciate...

	Yes, netwave_cs got it wrong. On the other hand, wavelan_cs
got it right, as far as 2.3.49. I'll show in a minute. Dag won't fix
the Netwave, and I may decide to look into it, but can't promise
anything. I'll also send a patch to Alan block the Get-Encode before
the driver, to avoid this kind of nasty.

	Yep. I don't use this feature, but mea culpa. Send the patch
away, I'll update the Pcmcia package.

	Perfect, nothing to say...

	That's wrong. The current code look like :
-------------------------------------------
    case SIOCGIWENCODE:
      /* Read the encryption key */
      if(!mmc_encr(base))
	{
	  ret = -EOPNOTSUPP;
	  break;
	}
      /* only super-user can see encryption key */
      if(!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
	{
	  ret = -EPERM;
	  break;
	}
-------------------------------------------
	This allow to know if the card support encryption or not even
as a normal user, which I don't consider a sensitive information.

	Perfect...
	Thanks for the good job !
