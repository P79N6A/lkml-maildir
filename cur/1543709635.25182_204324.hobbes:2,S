Can you use a read-write lock, so that userspace copies only need to
take the lock for reading?  That doesn't eliminate cacheline bouncing
but does eliminate the serialisation.
Or did you do that already, and found performance is still very low?

If this isn't fixed, _please_ provide a way for a garbage collector to
query the kernel as to whether this race condition is present.
