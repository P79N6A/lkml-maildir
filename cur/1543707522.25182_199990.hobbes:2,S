Thank you very much for patching smartctl and explaining howto calulate
the LBA from those values.
So at least my hd crash had some sense.

Why are we bound to a 28 bit value?
As there are currently more and more disks out there with >=260GB, I
think this will be an issue very soon.
Have a nice day,
