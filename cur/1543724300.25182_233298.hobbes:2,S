Suggest a "\n" at the end of that.  Maybe add the precomputed value to 
help bring incorrect presets to someone's attention, something like:
+		printk("BogoMIPS preset to %lu.%02lu\n",
+			loops_per_jiffy/(500000/HZ),
+			(loops_per_jiffy/(5000/HZ)) % 100);

I suppose it may result in unpredictable I/O errors, in case we want to 
warn against that.
