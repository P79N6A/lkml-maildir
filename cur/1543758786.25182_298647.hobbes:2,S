Here's the diff of dmesgs between 2.6.10 and 2.6.11
2.6.10
>i8042.c: Warning: Keylock active.
>serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
>serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
2.6.11
< ACPI: PS/2 Keyboard Controller [KBC] at I/O 0x60, 0x66, irq 1
< ACPI: PS/2 Mouse Controller [PS2M] at irq 12
< i8042.c: Can't read CTR while initializing i8042.
booting with i8042.debug=1 gives:
ACPI: PS/2 Keyboard Controller [KBC] at I/O 0x60, 0x66, irq 1
ACPI: PS/2 Mouse Controller [PS2M] at irq 12
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 20 -> i8042 (command) [0]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:      -- i8042 (timeout) [508]
i8042.c: Can't read CTR while initializing i8042.
workaround is to boot with i8042.noacpi=1
i8042: ACPI detection disabled
i8042.c: Warning: Keylock active.
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
