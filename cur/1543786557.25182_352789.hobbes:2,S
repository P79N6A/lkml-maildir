These two should make it clear that there were only 1611 dentries
in the dcache and 839 in LRU list. Not too many pinned dentries.
So, all the dentries you saw in the slab were dentries out
of dcache but waiting for corresponding RCU grace periods
to happen.
This can happen if a task runs for too long inside the kernel
holding up context switches or usermode code running on that
cpu. The fact that RCU grace period eventually happens
and the dentries are freed means that something intermittently
holds up RCU. Is this 2.6.10 vanilla or does it have other
patches in there ?
Thanks
