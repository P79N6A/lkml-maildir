Linux, at least ext2, also implements volume names.
You can set or display volume labels with e2label(8),
mount is willing to mount by label; e.g., my /etc/fstab has
LABEL=Boot      /boot        ext2    noauto          0 0
for the boot partition.
Furthermore, cfdisk will show volume labels.
So, there is some minimal support, only very few people use it.
