Subject: Update: Semaphore errors w/intel8x0, but NOT due to ACPI

I recompiled my 2.6.3 kernel without any ACPI support but with APM
support (as a module) to see if, as Jaroslav suggested, the semaphore
errors I get are due to ACPI.  I'm afraid they aren't.  After some
hours of the laptop being on, but the soundcard unused, I tried to
play a sound.  Nothing came out.  The usual semaphore errors were in
the syslog.
Please help.  I'm at wit's end with this bug, which has been with me
since November.
I have appended part of my previous post for diagnosis.
