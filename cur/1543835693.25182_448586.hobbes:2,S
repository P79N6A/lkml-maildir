How about checking for regs->cs != __USER_CS instead?  In 64-bit mode
a program shouldn't have any other value there while in 32-bit mode
it could be using LDT segments.

When testing for the REX instruction prefix, first check
for 32-bit mode because in compat mode the REX prefix is an
increment instruction.
