Andre, what's to prevent root from coming in, replacing your safe kernel
2.4.0 with unsafe 2.2.x, rebooting, and exploiting the hole? Or loading a
module which is basically the old IDE driver or altering the kernel memory
image or directly writing to hardware? Nothing. Root is inherently allowed
to do this. They can even install Windows on you which is arguably worse
than a dead drive.
If root is hostile, you're dead. You cannot secure a system against a
hostile root except by making backups. Therefore, this is not a security
issue.
On the other hand, if root is being clumsy and asking the kernel to do
something silly, we can put a small obstacle in the way of that if it's
not too much trouble.
