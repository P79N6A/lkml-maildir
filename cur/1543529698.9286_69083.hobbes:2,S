I checked the system, and found out the on-board controller
is AIC-7890.  The version in trouble is v5.1.28.  The version 
that was compiled for Redhat-supplied kernel is v5.1.21 with
the taggedcommand queueing disabled. I need t.c.q.  
Just found out that another poster reported the same symptom
in the mailing list.  Like her, I will go back to v5.1.20.
