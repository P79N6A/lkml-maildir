Under such a setup, what is the easiest method to shut down the  
bridge chip
for power savings?  On my Debian laptop where said drivers are  
modular, I can
run "/etc/init.d/pcmcia stop" to unload the module and disable the  
PCMCIA chip,
saving a noticeable amount of power.  Is there some equivalent for  
compiled-in
drivers?  Thanks!
Cheers,

software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best  
answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it
because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why
I draw cartoons. It's my life." -- Charles Shultz
