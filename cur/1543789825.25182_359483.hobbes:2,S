No and yes. =) To me, broken code is bad code. If code looks good or
not is another issue.
Anyway, I fully agree that using constants are better than hard coded
values. I just prefer to stay out of naming discussions. They tend to
go on forever and I find them pointless.

Thank you for that suggestion.

I saw that akpm commented regarding duplicated code and I figured it
would be better to break out these functions. And if someone has
written similar code before then it is probably a good sign saying
that something similar is needed.

Yeah, thanks for stating the obvious.
