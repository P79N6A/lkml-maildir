The correctable ECC is supposed to be just that (correctable). It's
supposed to be entirely transparent to the CPU/Software. An additional
read of the affected error produces the same correction so the CPU
will never even know. The x86 CPU/Software is only notified on an
uncorrectable error. I don't know of any SDRAM controller that
generates an interrupt upon a correctable error. Some store "logging"
information internally, very difficult to get at on a running system.
Given that, "scrubbing" RAM seems to be somewhat useless on a
running system. The next write to the affected area will fix the
ECC bits, that't what is supposed to clear up the condition.
