OK. Thanks for the explanation. We'd (apparently) buy them, as
evidenced by the disks I found on a random search for maxtor
drives in my company. (about half are maxtor).
The 160G 5400 RPM drives will do 36 Mbyte per second, the 7200 versions
might do 50Mb per second, the difference is unimportant.

We're getting annoyed at WD because they are selling WD800 drives 
(80G) with 2, 4, 6 and 8 heads(*). So when we order a replacement
WD800 for spare parts for a broken one, we might end up with a
different generation drive which is useless for the "part exchange"
project....
(*) they probably don't sell the full complement... yet.

You're assuming that a head-switch is faster than a track-to-track seek.
Apparently that is no longer true. We've seen drives that "scan" a whole
platter before switching heads. We've seen drives that do this on a 
per-region basis.

How about: "Opening it up and having a peek?" :-) That certainly
works. But most vendors don't let me do that before I buy.  :-)
