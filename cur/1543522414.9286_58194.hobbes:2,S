PDP8-A (0.075 Mips, 1.6 us memory access cycle), 64 KWords x 12 bits,
connected with 12 block-mode terminals with local edition (12 users),
printers and some other peripherals as protocomposer, tape, ..., running a
full preemptive O/S, making good use of overlay for batch processing,
fully interrupt driven, DMAing from disks, etc ... (all the code including
boot rom being proprietary). Could be paired with parallel port and
mirrored disk data between the both machines. Booted in less than half a
second.
This was in 1979/80 and such systems have probably been used until 1985 
or later.
