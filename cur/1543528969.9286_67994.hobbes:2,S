"struct file_operations" is larger than you show. Therefore, when
you initialize it, you either fill in all the blanks with NULLs or
you leave a trailing comma like.....
   NULL, };          /*release*/
       ^_______ Right here.
Trailing commas are allowed, but not good coding style. I suggest you
fill in all the blanks. There was a recent change in the kernel (six
months ago), that changed the size of this structure. The hack to
get around this, until the size stabilizes, is the trailing comma.
