Hi,
the 2.6.13 and 2.6.14-* kernels seem susceptible to a race condition
between the sending of a "mount" uevent and the actual mount becoming
visible thru /proc/mounts, at least when the kernel is configured
with voluntary preemption. 
The following scenario: 
- system is using the HAL daemon, configured to monitor kernel uvents
- someone (usually some kind of volume manager in response to
  a device hotplug, but could also a manual mount) mounts a filesystem
- "mount" uevent is emitted
- HAL daemon reads the event, then opens and reads /proc/mounts
  (in order to determine the corresponding mount point, since the uevent
  contains only the sysfs device name), but /proc/mounts does not
  (yet) contain the corresponding line
There has been one previous post about this:
