I know this isn't the best place to ask this  question -- it's kind of a 
newbie question -- but I'm very frustrated.  
Ever since I started using the 2.6.9 kernel and above, I have had  frequent 
troubles compiling drivers AFTER the new kernel is installed and booted  up. 
In other words, no issue compiling the kernel itself, as well as all  the 
modules. But then, if I try to compile a module later (i.e., 3ware 9xxx  driver 
or Chelsio 10 Gigabit NIC driver), when I type: 
"make" or "make  -f Makefile" I get back an error: 
"No rule to make target 'for' "   or "No rule to make target 'driver' ".  
Have I missed configuring something  in the kernel. I have gotten this to work 
once with the 2.6.10 kernel, but I  don't know what I did differently then. 
I would appreciate your help  here.
