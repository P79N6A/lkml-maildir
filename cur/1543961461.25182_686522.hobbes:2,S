Subject: [PATCH 00/10] Scalability requirements for sysv ipc - v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After scalability problems had been detected when using the sysV ipcs, I
have proposed to use an RCU based implementation of the IDR api instead
(see thread 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/11/212
).
Resending the patch series after
 . integrating Paul's remarks
 . fixing a bug I had introduced
 . porting it to 2.6.25-mm1.
Reviewers are still welcome!
Patch 1 can be taken alone: it fixes a problem in the existing IDR API.
Patches should be applied on linux-2.6.25-mm1, in the following order:
[ PATCH 01/10 ] : idr_minor_fix.patch
[ PATCH 02/10 ] : ridr_structure.patch
[ PATCH 03/10 ] : ridr_pre_get.patch
[ PATCH 04/10 ] : ridr_init.patch
[ PATCH 05/10 ] : ridr_get_new_above.patch
[ PATCH 06/10 ] : ridr_get_new.patch
[ PATCH 07/10 ] : ridr_find.patch
[ PATCH 08/10 ] : ridr_remove.patch
[ PATCH 09/10 ] : ipc_use_ridr.patch
[ PATCH 10/10 ] : remove_ipc_lock_down.patch
Regards,
Nadia
