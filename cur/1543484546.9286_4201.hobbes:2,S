I don't quite follow your line of argument here as I currently have (
following the reset in my earlier message):
/dev/hdb:
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  1 (on)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 1023/64/63, sectors = 4124736, start = 0
which seems quite OK, given that the CDROM DMA noes not work.
