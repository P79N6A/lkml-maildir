I added the following three types for ext2(like ext3).
typedef unsigned long ext2_fsblk_t; (for filesystem relative block)
typedef long ext2_grpblk_t; (for group relative block)
typedef unsigned long ext2_fileblk_t; (for file relative offset)
This series of patches give unity, which make maintenance easier
and code clearer.
[patch 1/3] ext2_fsblk_t.patch
convert ext2 filesystem blocks to ext2_fsblk_t
[patch 2/3] ext2_grpblk_t.patch
convert ext2 group blocks to ext2_grpblk_t
[patch 3/3] ext2_fileblk_t.patch
convert ext2 file offset to ext2_fileblk_t
Any comments?
