I could see this in some sort of logging/monitoring situation where you 
want the latest data you can possibly get at each write. with the 
appropriate care in write ordering you could have one thread update the 
buffer continuously and the buffer gets written out periodicly, what gets 
written is the latest possible info.
definantly not a common case, but I could see it's use in some cases.
