I do a lot of stuff that involves attaching C++ code to C code. Really,
it's the C++ coder's responsibility to insulate other subsystems, if
they're bolting C++ onto a C framework. Likewise, when a C programmer is
bolting C code onto C++, it's his responsibility to ensure that the C++
base is unaffected.
I've seen C++ code that plugs into the kernel (it was a driver module,
in fact). No changes to the kernel required, just a little care from the
C++ coder.
So...why are you guys fighting? Is it just on principle, or is there
some valid objection that hasn't been raised yet?
