Ok, if you use both files.
Better a single file because:
- I18n support. (But not a big issue for us).
- CML2 merges all arch configurations in one file (really in 4
file:
  rules, menu strings, ...)
  Thus because we merge also configuration, I think that it is
better
  not to split the helps.
- IIRC there is only few ARCH specific configuration, thus we
don't
  reduce the size of che Configure.help
  Note that the arch/config.in have to much configuration item
  (but they repeat in (nearly) all arch/config.in files, thus
you
  should count only the really arch specific item.
I would prefer to have config.in and help file togheter. But
in the
discussion in kbuild list, it come that is is better to merge
all configuration in one file and the strings in an other (and
thus
not to merge Configure.help to not heve a very huge file).
What are the advanteget to split the Configure.help?

I think I missunderstood you. But this was the big issue for
splitting Configure.help. (Thus if an developer should use
at arch specific help, he should use this method)

I think it is not a big issue. In Makefile we can
: cat Conf.help.1 Conf.help2 > .Conf.help
