>I'll try that. I'm currently rebuilding the kernel, APM is working lousy on my Compaq 12LX302 laptop so I'm recompiling without APIC to see if that makes a change. Anyway, that takes a while, I'll report back on this.
Okay, APM is still a big mess for this Laptop, but I had a chance to try out the above patch. As expected this at least prevents hitting the "protocol is buggy" message in dev.c. If other people want to try, the file af_packet.c located in net/packet (and not in net/core).
I intent to try to dump this depricated socket use in the application, needs some experimentation and testing. So far so good.
Kind regards,
Henk.
