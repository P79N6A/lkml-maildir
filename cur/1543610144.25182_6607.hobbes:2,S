For bootimg, which does quite similar things, you may want to try
the patches by Mission Critical Linux, which include bootimg
http://oss.mclx.com/downloads/patches/
(up to 2.4.7, ia32 only)
You also need their version of bootimg(8) in mcore-user,
http://oss.mclx.com/projects/mcore/download.php
There is documentation on 
http://bootimg.sourceforge.net/
bootimg differs from kexec in that it tries to handle as much
policy as possible in user space, keeping the kernel part
comparably small.
