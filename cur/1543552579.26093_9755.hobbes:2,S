Hi,
I've got a PCI resource conflict on PowerPC Motorola MCP 750 system
while booting 2.4.0-test10. It works happily under 2.2.16 w/o any problems.
messages and lspci for 2.2.16 and 2.4.0-test10 attached.
I'd be grateful on any comments, thanks :)
BTW, Martin, do you know why to complain about inability to handle 64 bit address
space
             for bridge in 2.4 "drivers/pci/pci.c"
   613  #if BITS_PER_LONG == 64
   614          base |= ((long) mem_base_hi) << 32;
   615          limit |= ((long) mem_limit_hi) << 32;
   616  #else
   617          if (mem_base_hi || mem_limit_hi) {
   618                  printk(KERN_ERR "PCI: Unable to handle 64-bit address
space for %s\n", child->name);
   619                  return;
   620          }
   621  #endif
like this? Isn't it easier just to set  corresponding registers for mem_base_hi
and mem_limit_hi to 0 ?
Otherwise it just does not work with bridges like DEC 21154, though they work
flawlessly in 32bit
system with this setting. Again, at the moment of this printk, child->name
contains nothing, which
is rather confusing. Or I've missed something?
Thanks,
    Vitaly.
