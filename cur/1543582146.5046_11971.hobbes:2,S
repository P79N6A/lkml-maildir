Working on it. I already have it so you can go from vgacon to /dev/fb and
back to vgacon. It is in the works to have vgacon restore the text mode,
palette and fonts when switching away from the X server. One of the
problems I have seen is under heavy load switching away from X often
doesn't restore the text console properly. Vgacon could. This is also
handy when the X server dies :-) As for using the card's BIOS. Yuck yuck!!
We have other platforms to consider like PPC. PPC is a pretty popular platform.
