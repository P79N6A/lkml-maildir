Normally networking isn't invoked with interrupts turned off, but
I suppose we don't have a choice here.  This is unique being a
place where you can get called with BH on, off, or IRQs off.
Given that this is only used for printk, the easiest solution is
probably just to disable local IRQs instead of BH.
Cheers,
