Subject: [PATCH for review] [116/145] i386: don't taint UP K7's running SMP kernels.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

We have a test that looks for invalid pairings of certain athlon/durons
that weren't designed for SMP, and taint accordingly (with 'S') if we find
such a configuration.  However, this test shouldn't fire if there's only
a single CPU present. It's perfectly valid for an SMP kernel to boot on UP
hardware for example.
AK: changed to num_possible_cpus()
