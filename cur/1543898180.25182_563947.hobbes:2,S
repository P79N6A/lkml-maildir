I wouldn't want to call it swap, as this carries with it block-io 
connotations.  It's really mmap on flash.

Correct.
BTW, you may want to have a look at my "[RFC] VM: I have a dream..." thread.
Here is an excerpt:
"What's more, there is no more swap.
Apps are executed inplace, as if already loaded.
Physical RAM is used to cache slower storage RAM, much the same as the CPU 
cache RAM caches slower physical RAM."
The thread ended with this conclusion:

Thanks!
