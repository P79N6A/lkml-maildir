EXPORT_GPL_FUTURE is used to mark _functionality_ as no longer available
after a grace period. So when one marks a set of symbols as GPL_FUTURE
that functionality ougt to be described in feature-removal.
Did you see any _functionaliy_ where GPL_FUTURE are used where it
is not warned in fetaure-removal that that _functionality_ are supposed
to be changed?
Or in other words - please be more specific.
