It is actually rather more complicated. Suppose I give you a pipe
pair handle. You can flink what was a private object and has no
meaning as a name.
Suppose I give you a socket what does the call man ?
Suppose I give you a handle to an anonymous mapping ?
Suppose I give you a handle to data, how do you know what disk
it belongs to ?
Suppose I give you an O_RDONLY handle to a file which you then
flink and gain write access too ?
