Bonk self on head.
Thanks.  This was the was the answer looking for, when I started this thread.
When I look at if that I angle I still think we have real issues.
Basically PageUptodate tells if we can let anybody see the page.
In this context PageLocked keeps 2 processes from doing an initial
fill of the page.  In particular we don't want someone calling
readpage and reading data off of the backing store before we can set
PageUptodate after copy_from_user.
So I agree that setting PageLock is necessary if you are skipping
calling readpage.
However the current code has a nice little race.
Process A puts in a write request into the lands in the middle of the page.
   The page is initially uncached, so and since we didn't write
   PAGE_SIZE bytes we don't set PageUptodate.
   We delay the write.
Process B reads from the same page.  So we call readpage (The page
   isn't uptodate).  And overwrite what was in the page.
Process C the kernel writer thread wakes up and writes the page
   to the backing store.  But we have lost what Process A put there :(
Since it is proveable that A came before B. (especially with a 30s
write delay), and A didn't read what B wrote we have one problem.
Since we never write what B wrote to the backing store,
we have another problem.
So I don't see how we can safely avoid a call to readpage if we are
writing data to a page, (and we aren't writing enough to set
PageUptodate).
In practical terms this only affects NFS currently as that is the only
fs that attempts uses generic_file_write and does writeback caching,
keeping the lock PageLocked across updatepage keeps smbfs safe.
And this still leaves it as an open question why keep the page locked
around the call to updatepage.  The only real function I can see is
for a data coherency lock. . .
