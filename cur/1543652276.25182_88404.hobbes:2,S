While I do agree your criticisms are fair, I think they apply to the 
overall system and not specifically to Marc's EISA code.  I've been 
hoping that someone would do the infrastructure work necessary to 
support drivers in a pci_driver-like fashion, and I'm glad Marc has done 
this.
That said, tangent to your argument, I would also like to separate the 
PCI ids from the C source code -- but still compile the PCI id table 
into the .o file by default.  There are certainly other uses for the PCI 
id table, but I think sufficient additional flexibility is afforded 
simply by the movement of the id table at source code level.
