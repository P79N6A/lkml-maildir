Yes. That thing was probably mis-named. It's much more commonly used for a 
"helper subsystem", ie things like pcmcia (that want PCI to be fully 
initialized and probed, but want to run before the actual device drivers 
start probing).

Well, you dropped the easiest: make saa7134 just use "late_initcall()".
It's not "correct", but it's certainly no less correct than just forcing a 
driver to be moved for link order reasons.
