The definition _is_ clear, ioremap() is called with what you find in
the base_address[] pointer(s).

It varies on different architectures if I remember correctly -
basically all you need to know is that whats found in base_address[]
is handed to ioremap().

Thats the x86 way, but since we want PCI drivers to work across
multiple architectures, you need to use the portable API - even if it
is obvious that readl/writel turns into direct accesses on the x86.

Of course they are, thats how the API is defined - there are no
problems with this at all. If you want one example where this is done
correctly, take a look at drivers/net/acenic.[ch] (there was a minor
update to make it run on big endian machines posted recently, the
updated driver version is at
http://home.cern.ch/~jes/gige/acenic.html
). Yes this is my code, I am
not trying to state it is perfect, but it does handle the PCI aspects
correctly.

Oh I never disagreed on this, if anyone feels like writing more
documentation, please do. I'd be happy to read it and provide comments
if you write something up.
