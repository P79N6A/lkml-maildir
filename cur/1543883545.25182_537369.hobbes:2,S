Well the cache_reaper of SLAB hits hard todays anyways. This will help
if they switch to slub because the counter consolidation is much lighter 
weight.

Ok will do.

Vmstat updates only touch cachelines that are node local. Data from
remote zones may be updated but pcps of those remote zones are for
this processor and have been placed local to the processor accessing them.
Thus no problem for monster NUMA.

I am fine with delaying this. I just wanted the timer guys to have a 
chance to shape this a bit. Not sure what they want. What they did to the 
cache_reaper in 2.6.20/21 is bad.
