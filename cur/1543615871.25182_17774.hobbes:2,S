Right.  There's also the case where get_block() returns -EIO when,
for example, it fails on reading an indirect block.  We end up
writing zeroes into some of the blocks.  But I think that behaviour
is correct.
(I think I'll add a buffer_mapped() test to this code as well.  It's
a bit redundant because the fs shouldn't go setting BH_New and not
BH_Mapped, but this code is _very_ rarely executed, and I haven't
tested all filesystems...)

I'll retest this, including the -EIO path.
