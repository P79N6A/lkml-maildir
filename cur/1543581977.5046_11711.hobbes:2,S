I use Starcraft behind a 2.4.0 (RH7) masq firewall using
netfilter/nat/iptables and it works fine by default.
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE  (or something very
close)
Under redhat 6.2, stock kernel, it also worked.  Under 7.0 stock kernel, I
had to echo 1 to that
/proc file you mention below.
