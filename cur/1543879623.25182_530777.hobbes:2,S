hmm yes indeed it should do the job, but I don't see how you do that.
For example, let say I want to use "aes-foo" with eCryptfs. I can give
a higher priority to "aes-foo" than "aes" one. When eCryptfs asks for
a aes cipher it will pass "aes" name and since "aes-foo" has a higher
priority then the cypto core will return "aes-foo" cipher, right ? But
in this scheme, eCryptfs has not a higher priority than other kernel
users. How can I prevent others to use "aes-foo" ?
Actually I'd like to say "'aes-foo' is a cipher used by one and only
one user". That would allow aes-foo driver to no reload the same key
for each block and to be more efficient for my common case.
thanks
