  Hi, all. I'd like to start out by thanking people who have responded
to my call for testing on AMD CPUs. Unfortunately, all the respondents
have AMD K6-2 stepping 7 and below. AFAIK, MTRR support is only
available for AMD K6-2 stepping 8 and above. So I'm resending my call
for testing.
If your /proc/cpuinfo reports AMD K6-2 stepping >= 8, then please try
out my patch. If you have a lesser CPU, don't bother anymore (I think
we've established that people with lesser CPUs are not affected:-).
The original call follows:
>   Hi, all. I'm asking for people with AMD CPUs to please try my latest
> MSR patch. I've laid the foundation for AMD support in the MTRR driver
> (in preparation for merging a patch from Alan Cox), and I'd like to
> get some testing done before I proceed.
> 
> So if you have an AMD CPU, please apply the patch and send me the
> contents of /proc/cpuinfo with and without the patch. Note that the
> patch doesn't add MTRR support yet: it just does some groundwork.
> 
> The patch is available at:
> 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
> 
> and is against 2.2.2+devfs. If you have a non-devfs kernel, that's OK
> too, you'll just get a few failed hunks in the credits and
> ChangeLog. It doesn't actually break any code. So applyling the patch
> against plain 2.2.2 will be fine.
> 
> BTW: make sure you set CONFIG_MTRR=y.
> 
> Also make sure you set CONFIG_MSR=n and CONFIG_PERFMON=n if you
> patched against 2.2.2 only (i.e. no devfs).
