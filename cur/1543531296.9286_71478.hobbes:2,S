Ok, sorry. Let me restate: no general-purpose MMU, no general-purpose
scheduler, like those of Linux are. Memory protection *is* useful, it
helps in debugging, and makes things stable. No wonder. Segments (the 
80286 way), for example, are great for this purpose. But that's only
part of what the linux mm does.  You don't need its complexity on 
embedded systems. The same goes for the scheduler.

That's their fault. They'll support that writing their own OS.
And, BTW, if they aim to put Apache on that hardware, i'll laught.
The Linux+Apache solution may be viable, as a low cost (they're there,
there're free) one. I've nothing against it. Until they start complaining
about that feature they want disabled because they don't like it 
(but make perfectly sense on the main Linux+Apache use).

The controller won't fail because of overcommitment. It will fail (not
crash, BTW) because the programmers misunderstood the meaning of malloc().
