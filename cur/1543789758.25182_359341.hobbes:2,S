Subject: [KORG] [RFC] Useful tools section on kernel.org?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Has anyone thought about adding a useful tools section on kernel.org.
Something that has direct links to tools such as ketchup, quilt, sparse,
mc with it's patch editor.  Something that would help wanna-be kernel
hackers get started.
I'm still finding cool tools to help with kernel hacking, and usually its
only because I stumble across them, or have another hacker tell me about
it.
Perhaps having a section on kernel.org (or is this better on
kernelnewbies.org?) That just focuses on the tools that kernel hackers use
to simplify there lives.
Or is there a global repository somewhere that already does this?
Thanks,
