I submitted a better patch to xen-devel that removes the need to modify any 
cpufreq modules - it directly traps the MSR writes and updates Xen's internal 
timers, something the patch above did not do correctly.
Please ignore the previous patch and update to the latest devel version of 
Xen, which should be incorporating the updated code in the next few days.
