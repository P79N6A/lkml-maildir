Is it possible to sufficiently hide "dirs inside files"
so that old tools will be unable to see them?
I just checked:
ls -d /foo  does lstat64("/foo", ...)
ls -d /foo/ does lstat64("/foo", ...)
	but
ls -d /foo/. does lstat64("/foo/.", ...)
Will it work out if "dir inside file" will only be visible when referred as "file/."?
