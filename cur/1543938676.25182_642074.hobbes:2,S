Yes, I spotted that. Enabling it required a Kconfig change or two and
enabling BOOT_IOREMAP. It then crashes early in boot on a call to strlen()
so I went with the stubs and SRAT disabled for the moment.

I made the assumption that they were basically the same. That is obviously
wrong from what you say below.

Ok, understood. When I next revisit this, I'll look at making ACPI_SRAT
and BOOT_IOREMAP work on normal machines and see what happens. Thanks.
