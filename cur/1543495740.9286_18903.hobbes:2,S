This is wrong. NFSv2 does allow for client-side caching, and the
write-gathering implemented on most servers gives a limited form of
server-side caching. The difference between NFSv2 and NFSv3 is that
the latter allows you to better control of the server-side caching:
the client has a way of telling the server that 'I've sent you all the
data I want you to write, please flush it to disk now'.
There is, however, still nothing in NFSv3 that breaks the idea of
statelessness.
Cheers,
