The sleep bit is sometimes enabled by default (it was for me).
You can clear it with eepro100-diag (I think it was the -Gww option).
The documentation for eepro100-diag is somehow sparse, but
clearing the sleep bit was discussed on the eepro100 mailing list at 
scyld.com in great detail. You might want to browse the archives there.
