Please don't remove the jffs2_gc_{fetch,release}_page functions. The
reason they're in a separate file is because that file (fs.c) is built
on Linux only, while the file you're moving the code into (gc.c) is
OS-agnostic; it's used on other sytems (eCos) too.
Rather than forcing eCos and any other systems which have a JFFS2 port
to implement a crappy Linux 'emulation' layer, I try to keep the
Linuxisms localised to certain files which can be completely
reimplemented for a non-Linux port.
