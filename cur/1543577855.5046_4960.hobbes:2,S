As it is a property of the mc146818, it should be constant across all 
arch that use drivers/char/rtc.c
Sparc uses drivers/sbus/char/rtc.c which is for Mostek 4802.  No comment
mentions a 500ms delay there - or in the file arch/sparc/kernel/time.c 
*However* the test for the 500ms is still in the latter (in set_rtc_mmss).

Yes, and possibly what I had in mind some 5 years ago (as I'm sure I would
have looked at set_rtc_mmss at the time...)

Calling it a "feature" is clearly easier - no code patched, no flag day
for new behaviour, and no need for user space utils to have to do a 
uname() to see if a 500ms delay is implemented.  The more I think about
it, the better I like this option.
