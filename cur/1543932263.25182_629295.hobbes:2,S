Hi,
This series integrate the processor.h header. There are a lot of things
that are deeply architectural differences between architectures, but
I've done my best to come to a settlement. 
With this series, I am very close to have selectable paravirt for x86_64,
It applies ontop of today's x86 git, mm branch.
