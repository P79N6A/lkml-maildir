 You mean once per write, don't you?  The index is w/o, unfortunately.

 The flip-flop is expected to be connected to the NMI input of the
processor, which for systems using local APICs means their LINT1 inputs (I
think it's broadcasted for all existing systems, although in principle
only the BSP needs to be connected).  But from the local APIC's point of
view LINT1 is just another local interrupt line which may or may not be
programmed for the NMI delivery mode and moreover, NMIs may arrive via the
LINT0 input or from the performance counter interrupt if programmed so
(this is the case with the NMI watchdog) or from another APIC as an IPI or
an ordinary interrupt.  These alternative sources are of course unaffected
by the flip-flop unless you have a strange implementation of the local
APIC.
