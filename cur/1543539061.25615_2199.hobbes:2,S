By your logic, BUG() is a very important function as well and worth every
optimization it can get, as it is used more than 800 times as well. 
I hope you didn't want to insult linux-kernel's intelligence by using such a
flawed logic; I assume you know that Rik had a good point (ie. on most
systems kernel memory is much less than userspace memory) and you were just
making a joke...
