And what does this have to do with this discussion? you can produce deadlocks
(and other less severe starvation situations) with a myriad of ways.
sched_idle is special in the same way as other rt classes are.
(you can eassily kill your box and nothing will help you, even)
I admit I feel comfortable only when sched_idle is available to root only
(just like the other non-timesharing scheduling classe), however, the
reasoning "we could get a bad situation when misused so lets kill that
feature" could be applied to almost everything.

why not forbid mandatory locks, btw? could easily create a deadlock
situation ;)

Quoting a whole posting without referencing it in any way is a bad habit!
