I hate to correct myself again. But this won't work either.
If we do this, we can use bit_spin_lock() helpers any more
to do bh_state manipulation :(
Yes. Bottom line is, we would increase the size of the structure
by 8-bytes on 64-bit machines. I don't see any way out of it.
But this would provide ability to let the filesystems know
that the we are dealing with large (> 4GB) of IOs (may be they
can allocated as much as possible contiguously), even if
we don't really do that big IOs.
Thanks,
Badari
