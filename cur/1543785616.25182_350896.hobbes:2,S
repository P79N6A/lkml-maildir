Hi Nick,
I have collected performance numbers for the lock less page cache
patch on the AIM - IO test.
The performance numbers are collected for 1-100 tasks 1-50 tasks and
90-100 tasks  both for with and without your patch. This was done on
2.6.13 kernel.
There's definite improvement when the tasks are small i.e ~50-70. But
when the tasks go beyond 80, we see a large performance dip.
I again profiled the 90-100 runs with spinlock's inlined, but couldn't
understand the reason behind the performance difference.
Please find attached the performance numbers as well as the oprofile logs.
Thanks & Regards,
Alok

A computer scientist is someone who, when told to "Go to Hell," sees
the "go to," rather than the destination, as harmful.
