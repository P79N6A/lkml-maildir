   This piece of code is taken from an old Minix source code tree, the file being 
boothead.s . Notice the port 0xED usage and the comment.
! Enable (ah = 0xDF) or disable (ah = 0xDD) the A20 address line.
gate_A20:
        call    kb_wait
        movb    al, #0xD1       ! Tell keyboard that a command is coming
        outb    0x64
        call    kb_wait
        movb    al, ah          ! Enable or disable code
        outb    0x60
        call    kb_wait
        mov     ax, #25         ! 25 microsec delay for slow keyboard chip
0:      out     0xED            ! Write to an unused port (1us)
        dec     ax
        jne     0b
        ret
kb_wait:
        inb     0x64
        testb   al, #0x02       ! Keyboard input buffer full?
        jnz     kb_wait         ! If so, wait
        ret
