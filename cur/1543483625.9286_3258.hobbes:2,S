We had the same problem with some IBM Intellistations we are using here
for our compute farm. Sending 1 machine back to IBM resulted in a BIOS
patch, and the statement that it was a kernel problem. They claimed that
some registers were being left with 'crap' in them resulting in an incomplete
reboot. I still have the name of the engineer at IBM if anyone is interested 
in talking to him.
