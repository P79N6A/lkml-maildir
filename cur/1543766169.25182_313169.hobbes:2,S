We had some discussion about this one, there just need to be a softirqd
wakeup , the netif_rx_ni() call isn't really needed .
How about removing the softirqd wakeup from interrupt context, and move
it into the softirq scheduler. That would solve this situation and all
others like it .. Plus reduce worst case interrupt latency ..
