Attaching the irq disabling to some spinlock is what would be 
artificial...  See the ahci.c patch earlier in this thread.  It is taken 
without spin_lock_irqsave() in the interrupt handler, and there is no 
reason to disable interrupts for the entirety of the interrupt handler 
run -- only the part where we call kmap.
This is only being done to satisfy kmap_atomic's requirements, not libata's.
I could add a "kmap lock" but that just seems silly.
