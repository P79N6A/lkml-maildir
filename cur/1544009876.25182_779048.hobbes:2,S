Yes we've got a lot (about 150 on kernelmoops last time I looked), of these reports now, all warnings. They are different than the double-release of a mutex that was found & fixed Yesterday by Andrew Morton, as these are in-e1000e-driver warnings from a mutex_trylock(), and have not, as far as I know, been flagged by LOCKDEP. I am reviewing all the reports to see if the total set of warnings show that driver is at risk for a deadlock. If so, obviously we'll fix it. If not, we might just remove the trylock warning.

I think these are probably due to akpm's patches yesterday.  I think 
they've already been dropped.  The original issue still exists however, as 
reported by Arjan (kerneloops) and others.
We have Dave Graham here working on this, he is not done yet but he is 
making progress.  We hope to have something to post soon.
