why don't drive vendors create firmware which reserved a cache-sized
(e.g. 2MB) hole of internal drive space somewhere for such an event, and
a "cache flush caused by hard-reset" simply caused it to write the cache
to a fixed (contiguous) area of disk.
the same drive firmware on power-on could check that area and 'write
back' the data to the correct locations.
all said and done, why wouldn't a vendor (lets just say "Maxtor" :) )
implement something like this and market it as a feature?
i'd happily spend a few extra bucks for something that given a modern
PSU providing a few Hz of power (e.g. 50msec) provided higher data
reliability in case of power failure..
cheers,
