I will never understand while you insist running a _production_ server on
some beta and alpha quality kernels.
Why don't you simply pull a RedHat, SuSE, Mandrake, debian or anything
else release version distribution, put it on your box and let it
provide the service? And if anything breaks you have a vendor to
ask. Gee, look they would make money from supporting open source
software. :-)
