Andrew and Dan,
Yes, I tried the above combination, and the stuck-in-single-step mode
after continuing out of the signal handler is indeed FIXED.
Some additional code was added to the i386 version of handle_signal()
(even before the git8 additions) so that the TF flag is now cleared and
the task no longer stops when it comes out of the signal handler and
returns back to the original execution stream.
Thanks.
