	Well, I'm currently stuck in the middle of a long fsck loop.  I
successfully ran fsck once, correcting errors.  I thought I'd double
check and ran it again.  The following is a short section from it:

	I've got it on USB 2.0.  I have a 1.1 port that I'll see whether I can
reproduce it on, once the fsck has finished!

	I was also trying rsync, but am now restricting myself to cp to see if
that helped.  It didn't seem to.
