Ok. Got it. So in this case we route the interrupts directly through LAPIC
and put LVT0 in ExtInt mode and IOAPIC is bypassed.
I am looking at Intel Multiprocessor specification v1.4 and as per figure
3-3 on page 3-9, 8259 is connected to LINTIN0 line, which in turn is 
connected to LINTIN0 pin on all processors. If that is the case, even in
this mode, all the CPU should see the timer interrupts (which is coming
from 8259)?
Can you print the LAPIC registers (print_local_APIC) during normal boot
and during kdump boot and paste here?
Thanks
